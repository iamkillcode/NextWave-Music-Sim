# EchoX Follower System Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a realistic follower system for EchoX (Twitter-style social media) that integrates with the existing fanbase mechanics. Followers grow organically from fanbase and loyal fanbase, and engagement (likes, echoes/retweets, comments) is simulated realistically based on follower count and fame.

## Key Features

### 1. Follower Calculation
- **Formula**: 30-60% of fanbase converts to EchoX followers
- **Loyal Fans Bonus**: 80% of loyal fanbase becomes followers
- **Growth**: Followers update automatically as fanbase grows

### 2. Realistic Engagement Simulation
Posts receive engagement based on:
- **Reach**: 15% of followers see each post (boosted by fame)
- **Engagement Rates**:
  - Casual fans: 5-15% like, 1-4% echo/repost, 0.5-2% comment
  - Loyal fans: 30% like, 8% echo, 5% comment (3x more engaged)
- **Fame Boost**: Higher fame = wider reach (up to 2x at 10k fame)

### 3. Follow/Unfollow System
- Players can follow other artists
- Followers receive notifications
- Follow counts tracked separately from fanbase

## Implementation Details

### Data Model Changes (`lib/models/artist_stats.dart`)
Added fields to `ArtistStats`:
```dart
final int echoXFollowers;        // Total EchoX followers
final List<String> echoXFollowing;  // Artists this player follows
final List<String> echoXFollowedBy; // Players following this artist
```

### Cloud Functions (`functions/index.js`)

#### `updateEchoXFollowers` (Callable)
- Updates player's follower count based on current fanbase
- Formula: `(fanbase * 0.3-0.6) + (loyalFanbase * 0.8)`
- Returns new follower count

#### `simulateEchoXEngagement` (Callable)
- Simulates realistic engagement on a post
- Calculates likes, echoes, comments based on:
  - Follower count
  - Fame level
  - Loyal fan count
- Awards fame for engagement received
- Formula:
  - Reach: `followers * 0.15 * fameBoost`
  - Likes: `reach * 0.05-0.15` (casual) + `loyalFans * 0.3` (loyal)
  - Echoes: `reach * 0.01-0.04` + `loyalFans * 0.08`
  - Comments: `reach * 0.005-0.015` + `loyalFans * 0.05`

#### `toggleEchoXFollow` (Callable)
- Follow/unfollow another artist
- Updates both users' follow lists
- Sends notification on new follow
- Increments/decrements follower counts

#### `dailyEchoXFollowerUpdate` (Scheduled - 3 AM daily)
- Updates all players' follower counts daily
- Only updates if change > 5%
- Keeps followers synchronized with fanbase growth

### Service Layer (`lib/services/echox_service.dart`)
Provides client-side interface for:
- `updateFollowers()` - Refresh follower count
- `simulatePostEngagement(postId)` - Add engagement to post
- `toggleFollow(targetUserId)` - Follow/unfollow
- `isFollowing(targetUserId)` - Check follow status
- `getFollowerCount(userId)` - Get follower count
- `streamFollowerStats(userId)` - Real-time follower/following counts

### Security Rules (`firestore.rules`)
Protected fields - only Cloud Functions can modify:
- `echoXFollowers` - Prevent fake follower inflation
- `echoXFollowedBy` - Prevent follower manipulation
- Money still protected as before

## Game Design Rationale

### Why 30-60% Conversion?
- **Realistic**: Not all music fans use social media actively
- **Variable**: Random range creates organic growth patterns
- **Scalable**: Works for small and large fanbases

### Why Loyal Fans Have 3x Engagement?
- **Dedicated**: Loyal fans consistently support the artist
- **Active**: They're more likely to interact with posts
- **Reward**: Rewards players for building loyal fanbase (quality > quantity)

### Why Fame Boosts Reach?
- **Celebrity Effect**: Famous artists' posts spread wider (algorithm boost)
- **Viral Potential**: High fame = more shares = more reach
- **Progression**: Incentivizes building fame alongside followers

### Engagement Math Examples

**Example 1: New Artist**
- Fanbase: 1,000
- Loyal Fans: 100
- EchoX Followers: (1000 * 0.45) + (100 * 0.8) = 530 followers
- Post Reach: 530 * 0.15 = 80 users + 80 loyal fans = 160 total
- Expected Engagement:
  - Likes: (80 * 0.10) + (80 * 0.30) = 32 likes
  - Echoes: (80 * 0.02) + (80 * 0.08) = 8 echoes
  - Comments: (80 * 0.01) + (80 * 0.05) = 5 comments

**Example 2: Mid-Tier Artist**
- Fanbase: 50,000
- Loyal Fans: 5,000
- Fame: 2,500
- EchoX Followers: (50000 * 0.45) + (5000 * 0.8) = 26,500 followers
- Fame Boost: 1 + (2500 / 10000) = 1.25x
- Post Reach: (26500 * 0.15 * 1.25) = 4,969 + 4,000 loyal = 8,969 total
- Expected Engagement:
  - Likes: (4969 * 0.10) + (4000 * 0.30) = 1,697 likes
  - Echoes: (4969 * 0.02) + (4000 * 0.08) = 419 echoes
  - Comments: (4969 * 0.01) + (4000 * 0.05) = 250 comments

**Example 3: Superstar**
- Fanbase: 500,000
- Loyal Fans: 50,000
- Fame: 10,000+
- EchoX Followers: (500000 * 0.45) + (50000 * 0.8) = 265,000 followers
- Fame Boost: 2.0x (maxed)
- Post Reach: (265000 * 0.15 * 2.0) = 79,500 + 40,000 loyal = 119,500 total
- Expected Engagement:
  - Likes: (79500 * 0.10) + (40000 * 0.30) = 19,950 likes
  - Echoes: (79500 * 0.02) + (40000 * 0.08) = 4,790 echoes
  - Comments: (79500 * 0.01) + (40000 * 0.05) = 2,795 comments

## Usage Flow

### For New Posts
1. Player creates EchoX post in app
2. Post saved to Firestore
3. Call `simulateEchoXEngagement(postId)` immediately
4. Post instantly shows realistic engagement numbers
5. Player gains fame from engagement

### For Follower Updates
1. Player's fanbase grows (from streams, releases, etc.)
2. Two options:
   - Manual: Player can refresh in profile
   - Automatic: Daily function updates at 3 AM
3. Followers increase proportionally to fanbase

### For Following Artists
1. Player views another artist's profile
2. Clicks "Follow" button
3. `toggleEchoXFollow(targetId)` called
4. Both players' lists updated
5. Target receives notification

## UI Integration (To Do)

### Profile Screen
- Display follower/following counts
- "Edit Profile" shows followers and following
- Follow/Unfollow button on other players' profiles

### EchoX Screen
- Show follower count in profile section
- Engagement numbers display automatically
- "Suggested Artists" based on genre/fame

### Post Creation
- After posting, engagement simulates immediately
- Show growth animation for likes/echoes
- Display reach/impressions stat

## Testing

### Test 1: Follower Calculation
```javascript
// Test new artist
fanbase = 1000, loyalFans = 100
expected = (1000 * 0.45) + (100 * 0.8) = 530 followers

// Test mid-tier
fanbase = 50000, loyalFans = 5000  
expected = (50000 * 0.45) + (5000 * 0.8) = 26,500 followers
```

### Test 2: Engagement Simulation
```javascript
// Create post as artist with 10k followers, 1k loyal fans
postId = "test_post_123"
simulateEchoXEngagement(postId)
// Expected: ~200 likes, ~40 echoes, ~20 comments
```

### Test 3: Follow System
```javascript
// User A follows User B
toggleEchoXFollow(userB_id)
// Check: userA.echoXFollowing includes userB_id
// Check: userB.echoXFollowedBy includes userA_id
// Check: userB.echoXFollowers += 1
```
