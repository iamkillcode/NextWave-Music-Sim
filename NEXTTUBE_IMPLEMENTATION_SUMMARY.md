# NexTube Upload Limits Implementation Summary

## 📦 What Was Implemented

A comprehensive three-layer anti-abuse system for NexTube video uploads:

### ✅ Layer 1: Client-Side Validation (Flutter)
**Files Modified**:
- `lib/services/remote_config_service.dart` - Added NexTube config parameters
- `lib/screens/nexttube_upload_screen.dart` - Integrated Remote Config, added server validation call
- `lib/services/nexttube_service.dart` - Already had helper methods (no changes needed)

**Features**:
- Configurable cooldown period between uploads
- Daily upload limit per player
- Duplicate title detection (exact + near-duplicate via Jaccard similarity)
- Official video uniqueness enforcement
- All limits driven by Remote Config (no redeploy needed)

---

### ✅ Layer 2: Server-Side Validation (Cloud Functions)
**Files Modified**:
- `functions/src/index.ts` - Added `validateNexTubeUpload` callable function

**Features**:
- Authoritative server-side enforcement (can't be bypassed)
- Reads config from environment variables
- Returns `{allowed: boolean, reason?: string}`
- Comprehensive checks: cooldown, daily limit, duplicates, official uniqueness
- Firestore queries for current state
- Error logging for monitoring

---

### ✅ Layer 3: Database Rules (Firestore)
**Files Modified**:
- `firestore.rules` - Enhanced validation for nexttube_videos collection

**Features**:
- Authentication required
- Ownership validation (ownerId must match auth.uid)
- Data structure validation (required fields, types, lengths)
- Prevents core field modifications
- Requires normalizedTitle for duplicate checking

---

### ✅ Admin Controls (Admin Dashboard)
**Files Modified**:
- `lib/screens/admin_dashboard_screen.dart` - Added NexTube Configuration section

**Features**:
- View all current upload limits
- View backend simulation parameters
- Refresh Remote Config on-demand
- Link to full config debug screen
- Visual display with descriptions

---

### ✅ Documentation
**Files Created**:
- `NEXTTUBE_UPLOAD_LIMITS.md` - Comprehensive technical documentation
- `NEXTTUBE_SETUP_QUICK_START.md` - Step-by-step setup guide (this file)

## 🎯 Configuration Points

### Remote Config Parameters (Firebase Console)
```
nexttube_cooldown_minutes: 10
nexttube_daily_upload_limit: 5
nexttube_duplicate_window_days: 60
nexttube_similarity_threshold: 0.92
```

### Cloud Function Environment Variables (Optional)
```
NEXTTUBE_COOLDOWN_MINUTES=10
NEXTTUBE_DAILY_LIMIT=5
NEXTTUBE_DUPLICATE_WINDOW_DAYS=60
NEXTTUBE_SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD=0.92
```

### Default Fallbacks (in code if Remote Config unavailable)
- All parameters have sensible defaults in `RemoteConfigService`
- Cloud Function has fallback defaults in `getEnvInt/getEnvDouble`

## 🔄 Upload Flow

```
User clicks Upload
       ↓
CLIENT CHECKS (instant feedback)
 ├─ Selected song? ✓
 ├─ Title entered? ✓
 ├─ Enough money? ✓
 ├─ Official video unique? ✓
 ├─ Cooldown passed? ✓ (query Firestore)
 ├─ Under daily limit? ✓ (query Firestore)
 ├─ Song+type unique? ✓ (query Firestore)
 ├─ Title not duplicate? ✓ (query Firestore)
 └─ Title not near-duplicate? ✓ (Jaccard similarity)
       ↓
SERVER VALIDATION (authoritative)
 ├─ User authenticated? ✓
 ├─ Load config from env ✓
 ├─ All same checks as client ✓
 └─ Return {allowed: true/false, reason}
       ↓
CREATE VIDEO (if allowed)
 ├─ Generate video ID
 ├─ Build video document with normalizedTitle
 └─ Write to Firestore
       ↓
FIRESTORE RULES CHECK
 ├─ User authenticated? ✓
 ├─ ownerId matches auth? ✓
 ├─ Required fields present? ✓
 ├─ Data types correct? ✓
 └─ normalizedTitle included? ✓
       ↓
✅ VIDEO CREATED
 ├─ Deduct production cost
 ├─ Link to Song if official
 └─ Show success message
```

## 🛡️ Security Model

### Attack Vector: Modified Client
- **Attack**: User modifies Flutter app to skip validation
- **Defense**: Server callable function enforces same rules
- **Result**: Upload blocked at server level

### Attack Vector: Direct Firestore Write
- **Attack**: User calls Firestore API directly
- **Defense**: Firestore rules validate structure and ownership
- **Result**: Permission denied

### Attack Vector: Concurrent Uploads
- **Attack**: User opens multiple tabs to upload simultaneously
- **Defense**: Server queries current state at validation time
- **Result**: Only first upload passes (others hit cooldown)

### Attack Vector: Clock Manipulation
- **Attack**: User changes device time to bypass cooldown
- **Defense**: Server uses server timestamp (request.time)
- **Result**: Real time used, manipulation ineffective

### Attack Vector: Title Obfuscation
- **Attack**: User adds spaces, special chars to bypass duplicate check
- **Defense**: Title normalization (lowercase, alphanumeric, single spaces)
- **Result**: Duplicates detected regardless of obfuscation

---

## 📊 Key Metrics

### Upload Success Rate
```sql
-- Successful uploads / Total attempts
-- Target: >90% (indicates limits aren't too strict)
```

### Rejection Breakdown
```
Cooldown violations: X%
Daily limit: Y%
Duplicates: Z%
Other: W%
```

### Player Behavior
```
- Average uploads per day per player
- Peak upload hours
- Duplicate attempt frequency
```

---

## 🎛️ Tuning Recommendations

### Initial Launch (Lenient)
```
cooldown: 5 minutes
daily_limit: 10
similarity_threshold: 0.85
```
**Rationale**: Give players flexibility while monitoring behavior

### Steady State (Balanced)
```
cooldown: 10 minutes
daily_limit: 5
similarity_threshold: 0.92
```
**Rationale**: Prevent spam while allowing legitimate creators

### High Abuse (Strict)
```
cooldown: 30 minutes
daily_limit: 3
similarity_threshold: 0.95
```
**Rationale**: Aggressively combat abuse until normalized

### Testing/Events (Open)
```
cooldown: 0 minutes
daily_limit: 999
similarity_threshold: 1.0
```
**Rationale**: Disable limits for special events or testing

## 🚀 Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Cloud Function deployed: `firebase deploy --only functions:validateNexTubeUpload`
- [ ] Firestore rules deployed: `firebase deploy --only firestore:rules`
- [ ] Remote Config parameters added and published
- [ ] Environment variables set (optional but recommended)
- [ ] Flutter app rebuilt with new dependencies
- [ ] Tested all validation scenarios locally
- [ ] Monitored Cloud Functions logs for errors
- [ ] Admin Dashboard displays config correctly
- [ ] Documentation reviewed and updated

---

## 🧪 Test Scenarios

### Manual Tests
1. ✅ Upload cooldown enforcement
2. ✅ Daily limit cap (5 uploads)
3. ✅ Exact title duplicate blocked
4. ✅ Near-duplicate title blocked (>92% similar)
5. ✅ Official video uniqueness per song
6. ✅ Server validation blocks bypassed client
7. ✅ Firestore rules reject invalid data
8. ✅ Admin Dashboard shows current config
9. ✅ Remote Config refresh updates values
10. ✅ Error messages are user-friendly

### Automated Tests (Recommended)
```dart
// integration_test/nexttube_upload_test.dart
testWidgets('Upload cooldown enforcement', (tester) async {
  // Upload video 1
  await uploadVideo(tester, 'Test 1');
  
  // Try immediate upload
  await uploadVideo(tester, 'Test 2');
  
  // Verify cooldown error shown
  expect(find.text('Please wait'), findsOneWidget);
});
```

## 📈 Monitoring Setup

### Cloud Functions Dashboard
```
Firebase Console → Functions → validateNexTubeUpload
- Invocations per minute
- Error rate
- Execution time
- Memory usage
```

### Firestore Usage
```
Firebase Console → Firestore → Usage
- Document reads (from validation queries)
- Document writes (video creation)
- Storage size
```

### Remote Config
```
Firebase Console → Remote Config → Analytics
- Fetch requests
- Active users
- Parameter values distribution
```

---

## 🔧 Maintenance

### Monthly Tasks
- [ ] Review rejection rates and reasons
- [ ] Adjust limits based on abuse patterns
- [ ] Check Cloud Functions costs (query-heavy)
- [ ] Update documentation with learnings

### Quarterly Tasks
- [ ] Analyze player feedback on limits
- [ ] Consider A/B testing different thresholds
- [ ] Optimize Firestore queries if expensive
- [ ] Update fallback defaults if needed

## 🆘 Troubleshooting Reference

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| "Upload blocked" unexpectedly | Config mismatch | Sync Remote Config & env vars |
| Server validation always fails | Env vars not set | Set function config |
| Firestore permission denied | Rules too strict | Review firestore.rules |
| Duplicate not detected | Threshold too high | Lower similarity_threshold |
| Admin shows wrong values | Config not refreshed | Click "Refresh Config" |
| Function timeout | Too many videos | Add pagination to queries |
