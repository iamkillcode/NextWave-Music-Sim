# Passive Streaming Income & Album Recording Fix

## Overview
Two major improvements to the game's music career mechanics:
1. **Album Recording Fix**: Albums now require RECORDED songs, not just written ones
2. **Passive Streaming Income**: Released songs automatically earn money over time based on streams

---

## 1. Album Recording Fix

### Previous Issue
- Albums could be created from written songs that weren't recorded
- This skipped the recording process entirely
- Songs would go from written ‚Üí album (skipping the recorded state)

### Fixed Implementation

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Need **3 RECORDED songs** (not written songs)
- ‚úÖ Need 40 energy
- ‚úÖ Songs must be in `SongState.recorded` state

**What Happens:**
1. System checks for recorded songs: `artistStats.songs.where((s) => s.state == SongState.recorded)`
2. Takes the first 3 recorded songs
3. Changes their state to `SongState.released`
4. Sets `releasedDate` to current game date
5. Awards album bonuses: +15 Fame, +$200K

**Error Messages:**
- If not enough recorded songs: "‚ùå Need at least 3 RECORDED songs to release an album\nGo to the Studio to record your written songs!"
- If not enough energy: Standard energy check applies

**Proper Song Pipeline:**
```
Write Song ‚Üí Record in Studio ‚Üí Release as Album ‚Üí Earn Passive Income
   (Written)      (Recorded)         (Released)        (Streaming)
```

## 2. Passive Streaming Income

### How It Works

**Automatic Calculation:**
- Runs every game time update (every real second)
- Calculates income from ALL released songs
- Updates in background without player action

**Income Formula:**
```dart
Quality Multiplier = song.finalQuality / 10  // Range: 0-10
Streams Per Second = qualityMultiplier * 0.5  // Range: 0-5 streams/sec
Streams Gained = streamsPerSecond * realSecondsPassed

Income per Stream:
- Tunify: $0.003 per stream
- Maple Music: $0.01 per stream
```

**Example Calculation:**
- Song Quality: 80 (Excellent)
- Quality Multiplier: 80 / 10 = 8
- Streams/Second: 8 * 0.5 = 4 streams per real second
- In 60 real seconds: 240 streams
- On Tunify only: 240 * $0.003 = $0.72
- On Maple Music only: 240 * $0.01 = $2.40

### Income Scaling

**Quality Impact:**
| Quality | Rating | Streams/Sec | Income/Min (Tunify) | Income/Min (Maple) |
|---------|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 90-100  | Legendary | 4.5-5.0 | $0.81-$0.90 | $2.70-$3.00 |
| 80-89   | Masterpiece | 4.0-4.4 | $0.72-$0.79 | $2.40-$2.64 |
| 70-79   | Excellent | 3.5-3.9 | $0.63-$0.70 | $2.10-$2.34 |
| 60-69   | Great | 3.0-3.4 | $0.54-$0.61 | $1.80-$2.04 |
| 50-59   | Good | 2.5-2.9 | $0.45-$0.52 | $1.50-$1.74 |

**Multiple Songs:**
- Each released song earns independently
- Total income = sum of all song incomes
- 10 high-quality songs can earn $20-30 per real minute

### Notifications

**When You Get Notified:**
- Income reaches $100 or more
- At least 60 seconds since last notification
- Shows: Total earnings + stream count + number of songs

**Notification Example:**
```
üí∞ Streaming Income
Your 5 songs earned $127 from 12,450 streams!
```

### Console Logging
```
üí∞ Passive income: $127.50 from 12450 streams
```

### Stream Count Tracking
- Each song's `streams` field updates in real-time
- Visible in song details and Tunify screen
- Persists to Firebase with player data

---

## Implementation Details

### State Variables Added
```dart
DateTime? _lastPassiveIncomeTime; // Track notification timing
```

### Methods Added

**`_calculatePassiveIncome(int realSecondsPassed)`**
- Called every game update tick
- Iterates through all released songs
- Calculates streams based on quality
- Applies platform-specific rates
- Updates song stream counts
- Awards money to player
- Triggers notifications when appropriate

### Integration Points

**In `_updateGameTime()`:**
```dart
// Calculate passive streaming income from released songs
_calculatePassiveIncome(realSecondsSinceSync);
```

**In `record_album` action:**
```dart
// Updates songs to released state
return song.copyWith(
  state: SongState.released,
  releasedDate: currentGameDate,
);
```

## Player Experience

### Before Fix
1. Write 3 songs
2. Click "Album" from Quick Actions
3. ‚ùå Skips recording process
4. ‚ùå No streaming income

### After Fix
1. Write songs
2. Go to Studio and record songs
3. Release album (uses recorded songs)
4. ‚úÖ Songs automatically earn streaming income
5. ‚úÖ Watch money grow passively!

### Strategy Tips

**For Players:**
- Record high-quality songs for better passive income
- Release songs on multiple platforms (Tunify + Maple Music)
- More released songs = more passive income streams
- Quality matters! 90+ songs earn 5x more than 50 quality

**Income Progression:**
- Early game (3 songs, 60 quality): ~$3-5/real minute
- Mid game (10 songs, 70 quality): ~$20-25/real minute
- Late game (30 songs, 85 quality): ~$100+/real minute

## Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Calculations run every second
- O(n) complexity where n = released songs
- Efficient for typical song counts (< 100)
- No database queries in calculation loop

### Data Persistence
- Stream counts saved with song data
- Money updates saved during regular sync (every 30 seconds)
- No additional Firebase writes needed

### Balance
**Current rates are conservative:**
- Real artists: $0.003-0.005 per stream (Spotify)
- Game rate: Matches real-world Spotify rates
- Time compression: 1 real second = 24 game seconds
- This makes income feel meaningful but not exploitable

**Tuning Options:**
If income feels too slow/fast, adjust:
```dart
const streamsPerSecond = qualityMultiplier * 0.5; // Increase/decrease multiplier
```

---

## Testing

### Test Album Recording Fix
1. Write 3 songs
2. Try to release album ‚Üí Should fail
3. Record songs in studio
4. Release album ‚Üí Should succeed
5. Verify songs are now in "Released" state

### Test Passive Income
1. Release an album (3 songs)
2. Wait 60 real seconds
3. Check money - should increase
4. Check notifications - should show streaming income
5. Check song details - stream counts should increase

### Debug Commands (in console)
```dart
// Check released songs
print(artistStats.songs.where((s) => s.state == SongState.released));

// Check current money
print(artistStats.money);

// Force passive income calculation
_calculatePassiveIncome(60); // Simulate 60 seconds
```

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
- **Viral Songs**: Random chance for exponential stream growth
- **Trending Bonus**: Newer songs earn more initially
- **Fan Growth**: Streams increase fanbase over time
- **Platform Bonuses**: Special events with 2x streaming income
- **Song Lifecycle**: Streams decay over time (old songs earn less)
- **Genre Trends**: Popular genres earn more during trend periods

### Balance Adjustments
Monitor player feedback on:
- Income rate (too fast/slow?)
- Quality scaling (linear vs exponential?)
- Platform differences (Maple Music premium worth it?)
- Notification frequency (annoying vs helpful?)
