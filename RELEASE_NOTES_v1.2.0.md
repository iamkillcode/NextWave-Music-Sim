# NextWave Music Sim - Release Notes v1.2.0

**Release Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Type:** Major Update - Charts System Overhaul

---

## 🎉 What's New

### Spotlight Charts System
Introducing the **Spotlight Charts** - a new global chart system featuring two distinct charts:

#### 🏆 Spotlight 200 (Albums)
- Top 200 albums ranked by total streams
- Gold theme with medals for top 3
- Albums-only filtering for focused rankings
- Real-time updates from Firebase

#### 🔥 Spotlight Hot 100 (Singles)
- Top 100 singles ranked by **recent performance** (last 7 game days)
- Dynamic rolling window - charts reflect current trends
- Classic songs can re-enter if they gain viral traction
- Info banner explaining the 7-day ranking system
- Orange-red theme with trending indicators

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

### Critical: Regional Charts TypeError [FIXED]
**Issue:** Regional charts crashed with error: `TypeError: null: type 'Null' is not a subtype of type 'Song'`

**Root Cause:** Data structure mismatch - service returned flat map, UI expected nested Song object

**Resolution:**
- Updated `regional_charts_screen.dart` to extract data directly from flat map
- Removed problematic type casting
- All chart entries now render correctly

**Impact:** Regional charts are now stable and functional

---

### Critical: Unreleased Songs Appearing in Charts [FIXED]
**Issue:** Songs in "writing" or "recording" state incorrectly appeared on charts

**Resolution:**
- Added `state == 'released'` filter in `RegionalChartService.getTopSongsByRegion()`
- Added same filter in `RegionalChartService.getGlobalChart()`
- Added filter in `SpotlightChartService` for both charts

**Impact:** Only properly released songs now appear on all charts

---

## ✨ Features & Enhancements

### New Song Model Fields

#### `isAlbum` (Boolean)
- Distinguishes albums from singles
- Default: `false` (single)
- Used for Spotlight chart filtering
- Fully serialized for Firebase

#### `last7DaysStreams` (Integer)
- Tracks streams gained in the last 7 game days
- Default: `0`
- Powers Hot 100 rankings
- Automatically maintained by stream growth service

### Automatic Stream Management

#### Rolling 7-Day Window
- **Decay Phase:** Every game day, ~14.3% of old streams drop off
- **Growth Phase:** New streams added to remaining count
- **Result:** Accurate representation of recent activity

#### Daily Update Integration
- Seamlessly integrated into `_applyDailyStreamGrowth()`
- Runs automatically without manual intervention
- Updates both total and recent stream counts

### Chart UI/UX Improvements

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### Stream Growth Service
**New Methods:**
```dart
int decayLast7DaysStreams(int currentLast7DaysStreams)
int updateLast7DaysStreams({required int current, required int new})
Map<String, dynamic> applyDailyStreams({required Song song, required int dailyStreams})
```

### Performance
- Zero additional database queries
- Efficient O(n) decay algorithm
- Minimal computational overhead
- No race conditions

### Data Integrity
- Automatic field initialization (defaults to 0)
- Backward compatible with existing songs
- Type-safe operations

## 📊 Chart System Overview

### Chart Types

| Chart | Filter | Sort By | Count | Reset |
|-------|--------|---------|-------|-------|
| Regional Charts | Released, Region > 0 | Regional Streams | Top 100 | Never |
| Global Chart | Released | Total Streams | Top 100 | Never |
| Spotlight 200 | Released, Albums | Total Streams | Top 200 | Never |
| Hot 100 | Released, Singles | Last 7 Days Streams | Top 100 | Rolling |

### How Hot 100 Works

**Traditional Charts (by total streams):**
- Classic Hit: 10M total → Always #1
- New Song: 50K total → Always lower

**Hot 100 (by recent streams):**
- Classic Hit: 5K recent → Ranks by 5K
- New Song: 50K recent → Ranks by 50K → Can beat classics!

**Result:** Dynamic rankings that reflect current trends 🔥
