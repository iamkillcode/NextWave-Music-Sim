# 📈 Dynamic Stream Growth System

**Date**: October 14, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**

---

## 🎯 Overview

Implemented a **realistic, dynamic stream growth system** that increases streams on each song over time based on multiple variable factors. Every song and artist has unique growth patterns - no two experiences are the same!

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. **Dynamic Per-Song Growth**
- Each song gets **different stream growth** every day
- Growth based on song-specific virality score (0.0 to 1.0)
- Random variations ensure no fixed patterns

### 2. **Loyal Fanbase System**
- **Loyal fans** consistently stream your music
- Grows when you release high-quality songs
- Can decrease if you release poor-quality songs
- Loyal fans stream **more frequently** than casual fans

### 3. **Multi-Factor Growth Algorithm**

#### Factors Considered:
1. **Song Quality** (0-100)
   - Better songs = more streams
   - Quality affects discovery rate
   
2. **Days Since Release**
   - **Day 0**: Release day spike (30% of fanbase)
   - **Days 1-7**: High discovery (algorithm boost)
   - **Days 8-30**: Medium discovery  
   - **Days 31-90**: Low but consistent
   - **Day 90+**: Long-tail (quality-dependent)

3. **Artist Fame & Fanbase**
   - Bigger artists = more discovery
   - Fame multiplies virality (0.9x to 1.1x)
   - Fanbase affects casual streams

4. **Platform Distribution**
   - **Tunify**: 85% of potential streams
   - **Maple Music**: 65% of potential streams
   - Platform overlap simulates real-world usage

5. **Virality Score** (Unique per song)
   - Calculated at release
   - Based on quality, fame, fanbase + **random luck**
   - Range: 0.0 to 1.0
   - Enables viral spikes randomly

6. **Decay Curve**
   - Songs naturally slow down over time
   - **Week 1**: Minimal decay (60% of peak)
   - **Month 1**: 50% decay
   - **Month 2-3**: Long-tail phase
   - High-quality songs decay slower

### 4. **Viral Moments**
- **Random spikes** can happen anytime
- Probability based on virality score
- **2x to 7x** normal streams when viral
- Makes hit songs feel special

### 5. **Listener Types**

#### Loyal Fans:
- Stream **0.5-2 times per day** (consistent)
- Earned through quality releases
- Never stop streaming your music
- Core revenue base

#### Casual Fans:
- Stream **0.1-0.8 times per day** (sporadic)
- Engagement depends on song quality
- Max 20% active on any given day
- Growth potential

## 📊 Growth Patterns (Examples)

### High Quality Song (90+) by Established Artist:

```
Day 0:   +15,000 streams (release spike)
Day 1:   +12,000 streams (discovery)
Day 2:   +10,000 streams (momentum)
Day 7:   +6,000 streams (still trending)
Day 14:  +4,000 streams (stabilizing)

Day 3:   🔥 +45,000 streams (VIRAL SPIKE!)
Day 4:   +25,000 streams (riding wave)
Day 7:   +15,000 streams (sustained interest)
Day 14:  +10,000 streams (still hot)
Day 30:  +5,000 streams (hit status)
Day 60+: +2,000 streams/day (classic)
```

## 🧮 Technical Implementation

### New Model Fields:

#### ArtistStats:
```dart
final int loyalFanbase; // Dedicated fans (0 to fanbase)
```

#### Song:
```dart
final double viralityScore;     // 0.0 to 1.0
final int peakDailyStreams;     // Historical peak
final int daysOnChart;          // Days since release
```

### Core Service: StreamGrowthService

#### Main Function:
```dart
int calculateDailyStreamGrowth({
  required Song song,
  required ArtistStats artistStats,
  required DateTime currentGameDate,
})
```

**Returns**: Number of new streams for that day

#### Sub-Calculations:

1. **Loyal Fan Streams**
```dart
loyalStreams = loyalFanbase × (0.5 to 2.0) random
```

2. **Discovery Streams**
```dart
// Day 0-7: High discovery
weekOneDiscovery = fanbase × 0.2 × viralityScore
decayed = weekOneDiscovery × (1.0 - daysSinceRelease/7 × 0.4)

// Day 8-30: Medium discovery
monthOneDiscovery = fanbase × 0.1 × viralityScore
decayed = monthOneDiscovery × (1.0 - (days-7)/23 × 0.5)

// Day 31-90: Low discovery
lateDiscovery = fanbase × 0.05 × viralityScore × random(0.5-1.0)

// Day 90+: Long tail
longTail = fanbase × 0.02 × (quality/100) × random(0.3-0.7)
```

3. **Viral Streams**
```dart
if (random() < viralityScore × 0.1) {
  viralStreams = currentStreams × 0.05 × (2.0 to 7.0) random
}
```

4. **Casual Fan Streams**
```dart
casualFans = totalFanbase - loyalFanbase
engagementRate = (quality/100) × 0.2  // Max 20%
activeListeners = casualFans × engagementRate
casualStreams = activeListeners × (0.1 to 0.8) random
```

5. **Platform Distribution**
```dart
tunifyStreams = totalStreams × 0.85
mapleStreams = totalStreams × 0.65
finalStreams = tunifyStreams + (mapleStreams × 0.4)  // Overlap
```

6. **Random Variance**
```dart
finalStreams × (0.8 to 1.2) random  // ±20% daily variance
```

### Virality Calculation (At Release):
```dart
qualityFactor = (quality/100) × 0.6 + 0.2      // 0.2 to 0.8
fameMultiplier = 0.9 + (fame/1000 × 0.2)       // 0.9 to 1.1
fanbaseMultiplier = 0.9 + (fanbase/10000 × 0.2) // 0.9 to 1.1
luckFactor = 0.7 + random(0.6)                  // 0.7 to 1.3

virality = all factors × clamped(0.0 to 1.0)
```

### Loyal Fanbase Growth:

#### High Quality (70+):
```dart
gap = totalFanbase - loyalFanbase
conversionRate = 0.05 + ((quality-70)/30 × 0.05)  // 5% to 10%
newLoyal = gap × conversionRate
```

#### Medium Quality (50-69):
```dart
conversionRate = 0.02 + ((quality-50)/20 × 0.03)  // 2% to 5%
```

#### Low Quality (<30):
```dart
lossRate = 0.01 + ((30-quality)/30 × 0.02)  // 1% to 3% LOSS
loyalFanbase -= loyalFanbase × lossRate
```

## 🔄 Integration Flow

### 1. Song Release (release_song_screen.dart):
```dart
// Calculate virality for this specific song
viralityScore = streamGrowthService.calculateViralityScore(
  songQuality: song.finalQuality,
  artistFame: artistStats.fame,
  artistFanbase: artistStats.fanbase,
);

// Calculate loyal fanbase growth
loyalGrowth = streamGrowthService.calculateLoyalFanbaseGrowth(
  currentLoyalFanbase: artistStats.loyalFanbase,
  songQuality: song.finalQuality,
  totalFanbase: artistStats.fanbase + fanbaseGain,
);

// Update song with virality
updatedSong = song.copyWith(
  viralityScore: viralityScore,
  releasedDate: DateTime.now(),
  daysOnChart: 0,
  peakDailyStreams: initialStreams,
);

// Update artist with loyal fans
updatedStats = artistStats.copyWith(
  loyalFanbase: artistStats.loyalFanbase + loyalGrowth,
);
```

### 2. Daily Update (dashboard_screen_new.dart):
```dart
// Called every game day (every real hour)
void _applyDailyStreamGrowth(DateTime currentGameDate) {
  for (final song in artistStats.songs) {
    if (song.state == SongState.released) {
      // Calculate growth for this song today
      final newStreams = _streamGrowthService.calculateDailyStreamGrowth(
        song: song,
        artistStats: artistStats,
        currentGameDate: currentGameDate,
      );
      
      // Update song stats
      updatedSong = song.copyWith(
        streams: song.streams + newStreams,
        daysOnChart: daysSinceRelease + 1,
        peakDailyStreams: max(song.peakDailyStreams, newStreams),
      );
      
      // Calculate income from platforms
      final income = calculatePlatformIncome(newStreams, song.streamingPlatforms);
      
      totalStreams += newStreams;
      totalIncome += income;
    }
  }
  
  // Update artist stats
  artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
    songs: updatedSongs,
    money: artistStats.money + totalIncome,
  );
  
  // Show notification
  _addNotification(
    'Daily Streams',
    'Your music earned ${formatStreams(totalStreams)} streams and \$$totalIncome today!',
    icon: Icons.trending_up,
  );
}
```

### 3. Firebase Save/Load:
```dart
// Save
await doc.update({
  'loyalFanbase': artistStats.loyalFanbase,
  // ... other fields
});

// Load
artistStats = ArtistStats(
  loyalFanbase: (data['loyalFanbase'] ?? 0).toInt(),
  // ... other fields
);
```

## 🔢 Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Consistent Quality Artist
```
Release 1 (Quality 75): +150 loyal fans, Virality 0.6
  → Growing streams, building foundation
  
Release 2 (Quality 78): +180 loyal fans, Virality 0.65
  → Both songs growing, loyal base increasing
  
Release 3 (Quality 80): +200 loyal fans, Virality 0.7
  → Momentum building, catalog value increasing
  
Result: 530 loyal fans streaming 2x daily = 1,060 guaranteed streams/day
```

### Scenario 2: Viral Breakthrough
```
Release 1 (Quality 85): +250 loyal fans, Virality 0.75
Day 1: +2,000 streams
Day 3: 🔥 VIRAL SPIKE → +12,000 streams!
Day 7: Still trending → +6,000 streams
Day 30: Hit status → +3,000 streams/day

Result: One song sustaining entire career!
```

### Scenario 3: Quality Drop
```
Loyal Fanbase: 800 fans

Release (Quality 25): ⚠️ -24 loyal fans (3% loss)
  → Disappointing fans, losing dedication
  → Lower engagement on future releases
  → Recovery requires quality return

Lesson: Consistency matters!
```
