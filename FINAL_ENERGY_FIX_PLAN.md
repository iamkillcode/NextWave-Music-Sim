## 🎯 Three-Step Action Plan

### Step 1: Setup Firebase Remote Config (2 Minutes) ⏰

Even though code has defaults, explicitly setting values ensures they work:

1. **Go to Firebase Console**
   - https://console.firebase.google.com
   - Select "nextwave-music-sim" project
   - Click "Remote Config" in left sidebar

2. **Add Two Parameters:**

   **Parameter 1:**
   ```
   Key: enable_energy_restore_fix
   Type: Boolean
   Value: ✓ true
   Description: Enable daily energy restoration
   ```

   **Parameter 2:**
   ```
   Key: energy_restore_amount
   Type: Number
   Value: 100
   Description: Energy amount to restore each day
   ```

3. **Publish Changes**
   - Click orange "Publish changes" button
   - Confirm publish

**Expected Impact:** 5-10 minutes for all players to get updated config

### Step 2: Monitor Debug Logs (If You Have Test Build)

Look for this pattern in console logs:

```
Every 5 minutes:
🔄 Starting Firebase sync...
✅ Got game date: Oct 23, 2025
🔄 Synced: Oct 23, 2025 (Day: 23)

When day changes:
🌅 Day changed! Old: 22 → New: 23
🔄 Reloading player stats from server...
🔋 Energy restoration: 30 → 100 (fix: true, amount: 100)
✅ Energy restored - Game Date: Oct 23, 2025
```

**Red Flags to Watch For:**
- ❌ `fix: false` → Remote Config not fetching
- ❌ `amount: 0` → Parameter not set correctly
- ❌ `30 → 30` → Logic not applying (code bug)
- ❌ No "Day changed!" message → Date comparison failing

---

### Step 3: If Still Not Working - Emergency Code Fix

If Remote Config doesn't solve it, apply this code change for guaranteed restoration:

**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`  
**Line:** ~1219

**REPLACE:**
```dart
// Use Remote Config for energy restoration with safe fallback
final int energyRestoreAmount = _remoteConfig.energyRestoreAmount;
final bool enableFix = _remoteConfig.enableEnergyRestoreFix;

// CRITICAL: Always restore energy to at least 100 per day
final restoredEnergy = enableFix
    ? (artistStats.energy < energyRestoreAmount
        ? energyRestoreAmount
        : artistStats.energy)
    : 100;

print('🔋 Energy restoration: ${artistStats.energy} → $restoredEnergy (fix: $enableFix, amount: $energyRestoreAmount)');

artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
  energy: restoredEnergy,
  clearSideHustle: sideHustleExpired,
);
```

**WITH THIS (SIMPLIFIED):**
```dart
// GUARANTEED ENERGY RESTORATION - No external dependencies
final restoredEnergy = artistStats.energy < 100 ? 100 : artistStats.energy;

print('🔋 Energy restoration: ${artistStats.energy} → $restoredEnergy');

artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
  energy: restoredEnergy,
  clearSideHustle: sideHustleExpired,
);
```

Then rebuild and deploy the app.

## 🧪 Testing Procedure

### Pre-Test Setup
1. Open app with low energy (e.g., 20 energy remaining)
2. Note current time
3. Note current game date displayed in app

### Test Execution
1. **Wait 1 real hour** (this equals 1 game day)
2. App should auto-detect day change within 5 minutes
3. You should see notification: "☀️ New day! Energy restored to 100"
4. Energy bar should show 100

### Alternative Test (Faster)
If you have direct Firestore access:
1. Manually advance `gameSettings/globalTime/realWorldStartDate` backward by 1 hour
2. Restart app
3. Energy should restore immediately

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

If energy still doesn't restore, check these in order:

### 1. Firebase Connection
- [ ] Device has internet connection
- [ ] Firebase authentication working
- [ ] Can see player data in Firestore

### 2. Game Time System
- [ ] `gameSettings/globalTime` document exists
- [ ] `realWorldStartDate` is set correctly
- [ ] Server time sync working

### 3. Timer Running
- [ ] `gameTimer` is initialized in `initState`
- [ ] Timer fires every 5 minutes
- [ ] `_updateGameDate()` is called

### 4. Day Change Detection
- [ ] `currentGameDate` is not null
- [ ] `newGameDate` is fetched from Firebase
- [ ] Day comparison logic works
- [ ] Logs show "Day changed!" message

### 5. Energy Restoration Logic
- [ ] Remote Config values accessible
- [ ] `enableFix` is true
- [ ] `energyRestoreAmount` is 100
- [ ] `artistStats.copyWith` called
- [ ] UI updates after `setState`

## 📊 Expected Behavior

### Normal Flow (Working Correctly)

```
Hour 0  → Game Day 1 → Energy: 100
        ↓ Player uses 80 energy
Hour 0  → Game Day 1 → Energy: 20
        ↓ Wait 1 hour
Hour 1  → Game Day 2 → Energy: 100 ✅ (RESTORED)
        ↓ Player uses 60 energy
Hour 1  → Game Day 2 → Energy: 40
        ↓ Wait 1 hour
Hour 2  → Game Day 3 → Energy: 100 ✅ (RESTORED)
```

### With Side Hustle (Energy Cost Per Day)

```
Hour 0  → Game Day 1 → Energy: 100
        ↓ Player starts side hustle (-20 energy/day)
Hour 0  → Game Day 1 → Energy: 100
        ↓ Wait 1 hour
Hour 1  → Game Day 2 → Energy: 100 (restored)
                    → Energy: 80 (after side hustle cost)
        ↓ Wait 1 hour
Hour 2  → Game Day 3 → Energy: 100 (restored)
                    → Energy: 80 (after side hustle cost)
```

## 🚨 Emergency Rollback

If energy restoration breaks gameplay:

1. **Disable Remote Config:**
   - Go to Firebase Console → Remote Config
   - Change `enable_energy_restore_fix` to `false`
   - Publish
   - Wait 5-10 minutes

2. **Temporary Manual Fix:**
   - Players can use "Rest" action (+40 energy) multiple times
   - Or provide emergency energy via admin gift system

---

## ✅ Success Metrics

After fix is deployed, monitor:

1. **Player Feedback**
   - Support tickets about energy should drop to zero
   - App store reviews should improve
   - Discord complaints should stop

2. **Analytics**
   - Average session length should increase (players can play longer)
   - Daily active users should remain stable or increase
   - Energy-gated actions (write song, practice) should increase

3. **Technical Metrics**
   - `remote_config_fetch_success` events in Firebase Analytics
   - No error logs related to energy restoration
   - Player retention rate improves
