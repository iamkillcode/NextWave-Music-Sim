# 📱 Push Notifications Implementation - COMPLETE

## What Was Built

A comprehensive push notification system that alerts players in real-time about:
1. **Post Engagement** - When their EchoX posts go viral
2. **Chart Achievements** - When they enter charts or reach milestones  
3. **Rival Activity** - When competitors overtake them

---

## ✅ Implementation Summary

### Client-Side (Flutter)

**New Files:**
- `lib/services/push_notification_service.dart` - Complete FCM service with token management

**Modified Files:**
- `lib/main.dart` - Added FCM background handler
- `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart` - Initialize push notifications
- `pubspec.yaml` - Added firebase_messaging: ^15.1.3
- `android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` - Added FCM permissions and metadata
- `ios/Runner/Info.plist` - Added background mode for remote notifications

### Server-Side (Cloud Functions)

**Added to `functions/index.js`:**

1. **`sendPushNotification()`** - Helper to send FCM messages
2. **`exports.onPostEngagement`** - Firestore trigger for viral posts
3. **`exports.onChartUpdate`** - Firestore trigger for chart achievements
4. **`exports.checkRivalChartPositions`** - Scheduled function (every 6 hours)

## 🎯 Notification Types

### 1. Post Engagement Notifications

**Triggers:**
- Likes reach threshold (100/1K/10K based on fanbase)
- Echoes reach threshold (20/200/2K based on fanbase)
- Post goes viral (2x expected engagement rate)
- First 1M likes milestone

**Example:**
```
Title: 🔥 Your post is blowing up!
Body: Your post reached 1,500 likes!
```

### 2. Chart Achievement Notifications

**Triggers:**
- Song/Artist enters Top 10
- Reaches #1 position
- Jumps 5+ positions

**Example:**
```
Title: 👑 #1 on the Charts!
Body: "Summer Vibes" just hit #1! You're at the top!
```

### 3. Rival Overtake Notifications

**Triggers:**
- Another artist ranks above you who was previously below
- Checks every 6 hours

**Example:**
```
Title: ⚠️ You've Been Overtaken!
Body: DJ Rival just passed you on the charts! They're now at #4.
```

## 📊 How It Works

### Architecture Flow

```
Player Action (Post/Chart Update)
         ↓
Firestore Document Update
         ↓
Cloud Function Triggered
         ↓
Calculate Thresholds & Check Conditions
         ↓
Get Player's FCM Token from Firestore
         ↓
Send Push Notification via Firebase Messaging
         ↓
Create In-App Notification in Firestore
         ↓
Player Receives Notification
         ↓
Tap → Navigate to Relevant Screen
```

### Token Management

1. App requests notification permissions on startup
2. Gets FCM token from Firebase
3. Stores token in Firestore: `players/{uid}/fcmToken`
4. Cloud Functions read token to send notifications
5. Token auto-refreshes and updates in Firestore

---

## 🚀 Deployment

### Step 1: Deploy Cloud Functions
```powershell
cd functions
firebase deploy --only functions:onPostEngagement,functions:onChartUpdate,functions:checkRivalChartPositions
```

### Step 2: Test on Device
```powershell
flutter run -d android
```

### Step 3: Verify
1. Create a post on EchoX
2. Have another user like it 100+ times
3. Check for notification
