## üîç Debugging

### Check FCM Token
```dart
// In dashboard_screen_new.dart, add:
print('FCM Token: ${_pushNotificationService.fcmToken}');
```

### View Cloud Function Logs
```powershell
# All functions
firebase functions:log

# Specific function
firebase functions:log --only onPostEngagement
```

### Test with Firebase Console

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Deploy Functions:**
   ```powershell
   cd functions
   firebase deploy --only functions:onPostEngagement,functions:onChartUpdate,functions:checkRivalChartPositions
   ```

2. **Test on Device:**
   ```powershell
   flutter run -d android
   ```

3. **Monitor Logs:**
   ```powershell
   firebase functions:log --only onPostEngagement
   ```

4. **Create Test Posts:**
   - Sign in to app
   - Go to EchoX (Media Hub ‚Üí EchoX)
   - Create a post
   - Have another account like it 100+ times
   - Check for notification

## üìû Troubleshooting

### "No FCM Token" Error
**Solution:** Ensure user has granted notification permissions. Check device settings.

### "Cloud Function Not Triggered"
**Solution:** Check Firestore rules allow Cloud Functions to read/write. View logs with `firebase functions:log`.

### "Notification Not Showing on Android"
**Solution:** 
1. Check device notification settings
2. Verify AndroidManifest.xml has POST_NOTIFICATIONS permission
3. Test with Android 13+ device

### "Notification Not Showing on iOS"
**Solution:**
1. Upload APNs certificate to Firebase
2. Test on physical device (not simulator)
3. Check Info.plist has UIBackgroundModes
