## Overview
Successfully implemented a comprehensive studio requirements and attitude system that creates meaningful progression tiers. Studios now act as gatekeepers to quality, with access requirements and dynamic attitudes based on player reputation.

#### 4. **Connection Benefits** (Legendary/Professional Only)
