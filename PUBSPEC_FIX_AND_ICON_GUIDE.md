# ✅ FIXED: pubspec.yaml Duplicate Key Error

## What Was Wrong
The `flutter:` section was **duplicated twice** in pubspec.yaml, causing:
```
Error on line 102, column 3 of pubspec.yaml: Duplicate mapping key.
uses-material-design: true
```

## What Was Fixed
✅ Removed duplicate `flutter:` section  
✅ Removed duplicate `uses-material-design: true`  
✅ Added `flutter_launcher_icons: ^0.13.1`  
✅ Added `flutter_native_splash: ^2.3.10`  
✅ Created asset directories: `assets/icon/` and `assets/splash/`  
✅ Configured icon and splash screen generation

   - Color: #1DB954 (green)
   - Add text "NW" in white, centered, large bold font

2. **Save it twice**:
   - `assets/icon/app_icon.png`

## ⚠️ Current Status

✅ **pubspec.yaml**: Fixed and working  
✅ **Dependencies**: Installed  
✅ **Directories**: Created  
⏳ **App Icon**: Waiting for your image  
⏳ **Splash Screen**: Waiting for your image  

Once you add the images, run the generation commands and you're done!

## 🐛 Other Issues Found

While testing, found these UI issues (separate from icon/splash):

1. **Duplicate GlobalKey**: Form keys conflict in widget tree
2. **RenderFlex Overflow**: Layout overflow by 12 pixels

These don't affect icon/splash generation, but should be fixed for production.

**Ready when you are! Just add your images and run the generation commands.** 🎨✨
