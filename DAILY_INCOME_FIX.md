# Daily Stream Income Bug Fix

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Issue:** Daily stream income was calculated but not persisted to Firebase  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

---

## 🐛 Problem Description

### Symptom
Players reported that daily stream income was not being added to their money balance.

### Root Cause
The `_applyDailyStreamGrowth()` method was correctly:
1. ✅ Calculating daily streams for each song
2. ✅ Calculating royalty income based on platforms
3. ✅ Updating `artistStats.money` in local state

**BUT:**
- ❌ **Not saving the updated artistStats to Firebase**

This meant:
- Income was calculated and shown in notifications
- Money appeared in local state temporarily
- **But after app restart, the income was lost** because it wasn't persisted

---

## 🔧 Solution

### Changes Made

#### 1. Added Firebase Persistence (Line 553)
```dart
// Save to Firebase to persist the income
_saveUserProfile();
```

**Location:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`  
**Method:** `_applyDailyStreamGrowth()`  
**Effect:** Now saves artistStats to Firebase after calculating daily income

#### 2. Added lastDayStreams Update (Line 526)
```dart
lastDayStreams: newStreams, // Update daily streams for daily charts
```

**Location:** Same method, song.copyWith()  
**Effect:** Properly tracks yesterday's streams for daily charts

## 💰 How Daily Income Works Now

### Income Calculation
```dart
For each released song:
  1. Calculate new daily streams
  2. Calculate income per platform:
     - Tunify: streams × 0.85 × $0.003
     - Maple Music: streams × 0.65 × $0.01
  3. Add to totalNewIncome

After all songs:
  4. Update artistStats.money += totalNewIncome
  5. Save to Firebase ✅ (NEW!)
  6. Show notification
```

### Platform Royalty Rates
- **Tunify:** $0.003 per stream (85% reach)
- **Maple Music:** $0.01 per stream (65% reach)

### Example
```
Song: "Viral Hit"
Daily Streams: 10,000
Platforms: [Tunify, Maple Music]

Income:
- Tunify: 10,000 × 0.85 × $0.003 = $25.50
- Maple Music: 10,000 × 0.65 × $0.01 = $65.00
Total: $90.50

Result:
✅ Money increased by $90.50
✅ Saved to Firebase
✅ Persists after app restart
```
