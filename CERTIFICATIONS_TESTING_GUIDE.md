# Certifications Feature Testing Guide

## Setup Requirements
- Firebase project: nextwave-music-sim
- Flutter app running with authenticated user
- At least one released album with some sales/streams

## Test Scenarios

### 1. Album Eligibility Check
**Location**: Album Detail Screen

**Steps**:
1. Navigate to an album you own
2. Check if eligibility info appears below the album art
3. Expected display:
   - Current tier badge (if any)
   - Eligibility text showing next tier and required units
   - Submit button (if eligible now)

**Expected Behavior**:
- If eligible: Green "Submit for Certification" button appears
- If not eligible: Gray text showing units needed
- Units calculation: `totalSales + floor(totalStreams / certStreamsPerUnit)`

### 2. Submit for Certification
**Location**: Album Detail Screen

**Prerequisites**: Album must be eligible for next tier

**Steps**:
1. Click "Submit for Certification (TierName)" button
2. Button should show loading spinner
3. Wait for response

**Expected Results**:
- **Success**: Green snackbar "Awarded [tier] [level]", badge appears, button disappears
- **Failure**: Orange/red snackbar with reason
- Album UI updates immediately to show new certification

**Validation**:
- Check Firestore: `players/{uid}/certifications` collection should have new doc
- Album document should update: `highestCertification`, `certificationLevel`, `lastCertifiedAt`
- Player should receive money + fame reward

### 3. Admin Migration (Admin Only)
**Location**: Dashboard > Admin Panel > Certifications

**Prerequisites**: User must have admin role

**Steps**:
1. Open admin panel
2. Find "Admin: Certifications" section
3. Enter a player ID (or leave blank for self)
4. Click "Run Migration"
5. Check the result dialog

**Expected Results**:
- Shows count of albums migrated and certifications awarded
- Can see "migrated: true, changed: X, awarded: Y"
- Check player's songs and albums for retroactively awarded certifications

**Validation**:
- Songs with sufficient units should have `highestCertification` != 'none'
- Albums with sufficient units should be certified
- All awards should have corresponding docs in `/certifications` subcollection

## Common Issues

### "Not eligible yet"
- Verify album has enough units for next tier
- Check Remote Config: `certSilverUnits`, `certGoldUnits`, etc.
- Formula: `eligibleUnits = totalSales + floor(totalStreams / certStreamsPerUnit)`

### Submit button not appearing
- Ensure album has `eligibleUnits` field populated
- Check that backend function is deployed: `firebase functions:list` should show `submitAlbumForCertification`
- Verify user is authenticated

### "User code failed to load" during submit
- This is a backend error - check Cloud Functions logs
- Verify function is in ACTIVE state
- Check IAM permissions (run.invoker should include allUsers)
