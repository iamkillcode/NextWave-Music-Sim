### Code Snippets

**Generate Initial Suggestions:**
```dart
// Generate initial suggestions based on default genre
int estimatedQuality = artistStats.calculateSongQuality(selectedGenre, selectedEffort).round();
nameSuggestions = SongNameGenerator.getSuggestions(selectedGenre, count: 4, quality: estimatedQuality);
```

**Regenerate Button:**
```dart
TextButton.icon(
  onPressed: () {
    dialogSetState(() {
      int quality = artistStats.calculateSongQuality(selectedGenre, selectedEffort).round();
      nameSuggestions = SongNameGenerator.getSuggestions(selectedGenre, count: 4, quality: quality);
    });
  },
  icon: const Icon(Icons.refresh, size: 16, color: Color(0xFF00D9FF)),
  label: const Text('New Ideas', style: TextStyle(color: Color(0xFF00D9FF), fontSize: 12)),
)
```

**Suggestion Chips:**
```dart
Wrap(
  spacing: 8,
  runSpacing: 8,
  children: nameSuggestions.map((suggestion) {
    return GestureDetector(
      onTap: () {
        dialogSetState(() {
          songTitleController.text = suggestion;
        });
      },
      child: Container(
        padding: const EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 12, vertical: 8),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          gradient: LinearGradient(
            colors: [
              const Color(0xFF00D9FF).withOpacity(0.3),
              const Color(0xFF9B59B6).withOpacity(0.3),
            ],
          ),
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(8),
          border: Border.all(color: const Color(0xFF00D9FF).withOpacity(0.5), width: 1),
        ),
        child: Text(suggestion, style: TextStyle(color: Colors.white, fontSize: 13)),
      ),
    );
  }).toList(),
)
```

**Auto-Regenerate on Genre Change:**
```dart
onChanged: (value) {
  dialogSetState(() {
    selectedGenre = value!;
    // Regenerate suggestions when genre changes
    int quality = artistStats.calculateSongQuality(selectedGenre, selectedEffort).round();
    nameSuggestions = SongNameGenerator.getSuggestions(selectedGenre, count: 4, quality: quality);
  });
},
```

## üéÆ Gameplay Impact

### Before Integration
```
Problem: Players wrote songs with generic titles
- "Song 1", "Song 2", "Untitled"
- Leaderboards looked boring
- No personality or memorability
```

```
Solution: Players get creative, genre-appropriate titles
- "Street Dreams", "Lagos Nights", "Block Hot"
- Leaderboards show interesting songs
- Songs have personality and context
- Still fully customizable
```

## üìä Metrics to Track

Once live, monitor:
1. **% of players using suggestions** vs. custom names
2. **Average time spent** on song creation
3. **"New Ideas" button clicks** per song
4. **Suggestion acceptance rate** by genre
5. **Character count distribution** of titles
6. **Most popular words** appearing in titles

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Ideas

**1. Title Templates**
```
- "The [Noun]"
- "[Adjective] [Noun]"
- "[Number] [Noun]s"
- "I [Verb] You"
```

**2. AI-Powered Suggestions**
- Use player's previous song names
- Learn player's naming style
- Suggest related themes

**3. Trending Words**
- Track popular words in top songs
- Suggest trending combinations
- "Others are using: Drip, Vibes, Dreams"

**4. Emoji Support**
- Allow emojis in titles
- Auto-suggest genre emojis
- "üåô Midnight Dreams"

**5. Save Favorites**
- Save unused suggestions for later
- "Favorite Ideas" list
- Quick-access to saved names

**6. Collaboration Names**
- "feat. [Artist]" auto-formatting
- Duet name generators
- Band name generators

---

## üêõ Known Limitations

### Current Constraints
- **4 suggestions only** (could be 5-6)
- **No title history** (can't see past rejected names)
- **No favorites** (can't save good ideas for later)
- **Static quality mapping** (could be more dynamic)
- **No adult content filter** (trusts word banks)

### Edge Cases
- Very low skills still get good adjectives (intentional)
- Can generate same title twice (rare, acceptable)
- No check for duplicate titles in player's library

---

## üí° Design Philosophy

### Why This Works

**1. Guided Creativity**
```
Players get inspiration without losing control
- Suggestions spark ideas
- Custom typing remains primary
- Mix and match encouraged
```

**2. Genre Authenticity**
```
Names match the vibe of each genre
- Hip Hop feels urban
- Country feels rural
- Drill feels aggressive
```

**3. Quality Progression**
```
Better players get better adjectives
- Beginner: "Late Dreams"
- Advanced: "Perfect Dreams"
- Master: "Legendary Dreams"
```

**4. Frictionless UX**
```
Zero friction to use suggestions
- One tap to select
- One click to regenerate
- Always visible, never intrusive
```
