## 🚀 What It Does

### For Players

  - **Announcements**: Global admin broadcasts
- **Actions**: Swipe to delete, tap to mark read, clear all
- **Real-time Updates**: Notifications appear instantly

### For Admins
- **Admin Dashboard** → "Send Global Notification"
- Enter title & message → Click Send
- **Instantly distributed** to ALL players via Cloud Function

## 📊 Notification Types

| Type | Icon | Example |
|------|------|---------|
| `admin_gift` | 🎁 | "You received $5,000!" |
| `royalty_payment` | 💰 | "Daily royalties: $1,234" |
