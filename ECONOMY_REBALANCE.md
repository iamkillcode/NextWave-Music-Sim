---

## Problem Analysis

### Previous Economy Issues:

**‚ùå Too Much Starting Money**
- Started with $10,000 ‚Üí Could afford mid-tier studios immediately
- No struggle, no progression tension

**‚ùå Excessive Song Writing Rewards**
- Writing songs earned up to $50,000
- Players could get rich just writing without performing/releasing

**‚ùå Unrealistic Concert Pay**
- Every concert paid flat $50,000
- No fame/fanbase scaling
- Instant wealth from first performance

**‚ùå Album Releases Too Lucrative**
- Flat $200,000 per album regardless of quality/fame
- Made albums the "easy money" exploit

**‚ùå Passive Income Too High**
- High-quality songs earned $20-30/minute from day one
- No fame/fanbase requirements
- Unrealistic streaming rates

---

## New Balanced Economy

### üí∞ Starting Money: $10,000 ‚Üí $500

**Why This Change:**
- Forces strategic decisions early
- Can't afford premium studios immediately
- Must choose between writing songs or recording
- Budget studios become meaningful choice

**Early Game Affordability:**
- Community Studio: $600 (need to save/earn first)
- Local Studio: $1,000 (achievable after 2-3 songs)
- Budget studios matter now!

---

### üéµ Song Writing Rewards: Reduced 99%

**Old System:**
- Max earnings: $50,000 per song
- Total for 3 songs: $150,000
- Too profitable, no risk

**New System:**
```dart
moneyGain = (quality / 100) * 100 * effort
// Max: $300 for perfect song with max effort
// Typical: $50-150 per song
```

**Breakdown:**
| Quality | Effort | Old Earnings | New Earnings | Change |
|---------|--------|--------------|--------------|--------|
| 90 | 3 | $50,000 | $270 | -99.5% |
| 70 | 2 | $35,000 | $140 | -99.6% |
| 50 | 1 | $25,000 | $50 | -99.8% |

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Writing is practice/preparation, not the main income
- Real artists don't get rich writing demos
- Encourages recording and releasing (where real money is)
- Makes studio recording fees meaningful

---

### üé§ Concert Earnings: Now Scale with Success

**Old System:**
- Flat $50,000 per concert
- No progression or scaling
- First concert = 100th concert

**New System:**
```dart
basePay = $500 (small venue)
fameBonusMultiplier = 1 + (fame / 100) // +1% per fame point
fanbaseBonus = fanbase * $2 // $2 per fan
concertEarnings = (basePay * fameBonusMultiplier) + fanbaseBonus
fameGain = 2 + (concertsPerformed / 5) // Diminishing returns
```

**Progression Examples:**

| Career Stage | Fame | Fanbase | Concert Pay | Old System |
|--------------|------|---------|-------------|------------|
| **Starting** | 0 | 10 | $520 | $50,000 |
| **Early** | 20 | 100 | $800 | $50,000 |
| **Mid** | 50 | 500 | $1,750 | $50,000 |
| **Established** | 100 | 2,000 | $5,000 | $50,000 |
| **Famous** | 200 | 10,000 | $26,500 | $50,000 |

**Additional Benefits:**
- +5-10 fans per concert (scales with fame)
- Fame gains have diminishing returns (prevents spam)
- Realistic progression curve

**Why This Works:**
- Early game: Concerts barely profitable (realistic struggle)
- Mid game: Steady income source
- Late game: Major money maker (as it should be)
- Encourages building fanbase and fame first

### üíø Album Releases: Quality & Fame Matter

**Old System:**
- Flat $200,000 per album
- Quality/fame irrelevant
- Exploitable for easy money

**New System:**
```dart
baseAlbumRevenue = $2,000 (advance)
qualityBonus = (avgQuality / 100) * $3,000 // Up to $3K
fameBonus = fame * $50 // $50 per fame point
albumEarnings = baseAlbumRevenue + qualityBonus + fameBonus
fameGain = 5 + (avgQuality / 20) // 5-10 fame
```

**Album Earnings by Career Stage:**

| Stage | Fame | Avg Quality | Album Revenue | Old System | Change |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------|------------|--------|
| **Debut** | 0 | 60 | $3,800 | $200,000 | -98% |
| **Sophomore** | 30 | 70 | $5,600 | $200,000 | -97% |
| **Breakout** | 60 | 80 | $8,400 | $200,000 | -96% |
| **Established** | 100 | 85 | $12,550 | $200,000 | -94% |
| **Superstar** | 200 | 90 | $24,700 | $200,000 | -88% |

**Additional Benefits:**
- +50-150 fans per album (scales with fame)
- Fame gain based on song quality (5-10 fame)
- Rewards quality and reputation building

**Why This Makes Sense:**
- Unknown artists don't get big advances
- Quality matters for commercial success
- Building fame pays off with better deals
- Realistic music industry progression

---

### üí∏ Passive Streaming Income: Fame-Gated

**Old System:**
```dart
streamsPerSecond = (quality / 10) * 0.5 // 0-5 streams/sec
// High-quality song: 240 streams/min = $0.72-2.40/min
// 10 songs: $20-30/min immediately
```

**New System:**
```dart
qualityFactor = quality / 100 // 0-1
fameFactor = (fame / 100).clamp(0.1, 10.0) // 0.1x to 10x
fanbaseFactor = (fanbase / 1000).clamp(0.1, 5.0) // Fanbase scaling
baseStreamsPerSecond = 0.01 * qualityFactor
scaledStreams = baseStreams * fameFactor * fanbaseFactor
```

**Income Progression:**

| Career Stage | Fame | Fanbase | 1 Song (80q) | 10 Songs (80q) | Old: 10 Songs |
|--------------|------|---------|--------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Unknown** | 0 | 10 | $0.002/min | $0.02/min | $24/min |
| **Starting** | 10 | 50 | $0.04/min | $0.40/min | $24/min |
| **Rising** | 30 | 200 | $0.29/min | $2.90/min | $24/min |
| **Known** | 60 | 1,000 | $2.30/min | $23/min | $24/min |
| **Famous** | 100 | 5,000 | $19/min | $190/min | $24/min |
| **Superstar** | 200 | 20,000 | $154/min | $1,540/min | $24/min |

**Key Differences:**
- **Early game**: Nearly zero passive income (realistic!)
- **Mid game**: Meaningful but not overpowered
- **Late game**: Significant income (rewards success)
- **Fame gates progress**: Must build reputation
- **Fanbase multiplier**: Loyal audience matters

**Why This Works:**
- Unknown artists don't get millions of streams
- Must build audience before passive income matters
- Rewards long-term career building
- Late game feels rewarding (exponential growth)
