**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE - Ready for Testing

## 🎉 What's New

### 1. **Regional Charts UI** 🏆
A complete charting system showing Top 10 songs per region with beautiful, medal-based UI.

**Features:**
- **8 Tabs:** Global + 7 Regions (USA 🇺🇸, Europe 🇪🇺, UK 🇬🇧, Asia 🇯🇵, Africa 🇳🇬, Latin America 🇧🇷, Oceania 🇦🇺)
- **Medal System:** Gold/Silver/Bronze for Top 3 positions
- **Real-time Data:** Queries Firestore for live chart positions
- **Your Songs Section:** Shows all your charting songs with highest position
- **Genre Color Coding:** Each genre has a unique color badge
- **Current User Highlighting:** Your songs have accent borders
- **Stream Counts:** Display regional or global streams per song

**Navigation:**
- Access via Dashboard → Quick Actions → **Charts** button (green bar chart icon)

**File:** `lib/screens/regional_charts_screen.dart` (600+ lines)

### 2. **Daily Royalty Payment System** 💵
Artists now receive royalty payments **every game day** based on actual streams, not on release.

**Previous System (❌ Removed):**
```
Release song → Get 10% of estimated revenue immediately
```

**New System (✅ Implemented):**
```
Release song → Get fame & fanbase
Each day → Receive royalties for that day's streams
```

**Payment Rates:**
- **Tunify:** $0.003 per stream × 85% reach
  - Example: 10,000 streams = $25.50
- **Maple Music:** $0.01 per stream × 65% reach
  - Example: 10,000 streams = $65.00

**How It Works:**
1. Song gets daily streams (calculated by StreamGrowthService)
2. Streams are distributed across regions (50% current / 30% fanbase / 20% genre)
3. For each platform, calculate: `(newStreams × reach × royaltyRate)`
4. Total income added to artist's money
5. Payment happens automatically at daily tick

**Updated Files:**
- `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart` - `_applyDailyStreamGrowth()` calculates royalties
- `lib/screens/release_song_screen.dart` - Removed immediate payment, added comments

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Regional Chart Service
**File:** `lib/services/regional_chart_service.dart`

**Key Methods:**
- `getTopSongsByRegion(region, limit)` - Query top N songs for region
- `getGlobalChart(limit)` - Combined chart across all regions
- `getChartPosition(songTitle, artistId, region)` - Get specific song's position
- `getSongChartPositions(songTitle, artistId)` - All positions across regions
- `isTopTenAnywhere(songTitle, artistId)` - Quick check for charting
- `getArtistChartSummary(artistId)` - Overall artist stats

### Stream Growth Integration
**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`

**Daily Growth Process:**
1. Calculate total daily streams (existing logic)
2. **NEW:** Distribute streams across regions via `calculateRegionalStreamDistribution()`
3. Update `song.regionalStreams` map
4. **NEW:** Calculate royalty income per platform
5. Add income to artist's money
6. Update Firebase

### Release Day Integration
**File:** `lib/screens/release_song_screen.dart`

**Release Process:**
1. Calculate regional fanbase growth via `calculateRegionalFanbaseGrowth()`
2. Update artist's `regionalFanbase` map
3. Initialize `regionalStreams` for song (if releasing immediately)
4. Add fame & fanbase (no money)
5. Save to Firebase

## 📊 Regional Distribution Algorithm

### Stream Distribution (Daily)
```
Total Daily Streams = 10,000

Distribution Weights:
- 50% → Current Region (5,000 streams)
- 30% → Regional Fanbase Size (3,000 streams)
- 20% → Genre Preferences (2,000 streams)

Example (Artist in Europe, Pop song):
- Europe: 5,500 (current + fanbase)
- USA: 2,000 (large fanbase)
- UK: 1,200 (neighbor + pop popularity)
- Asia: 800
- Others: 500
```

### Fanbase Growth (On Release)
```
Song Quality: 85 → Base Growth: 150 fans

Distribution:
- 60% → Current Region (90 fans)
- 20% → Origin Region (30 fans)
- 15% → Neighboring Regions (22 fans total)
- 5% → Global Viral (8 fans)

Neighboring Regions:
- USA ↔ Latin America
- Europe ↔ UK, Africa
- Asia ↔ Oceania
```

## 🎮 Player Experience

### Before Regional System:
```
Release "Summer Vibes" in USA
→ +50 fame, +170 fanbase, +$1,200
→ Get 100K streams
→ That's it
```

### After Regional System:
```
Release "Summer Vibes" in USA (Pop, Quality 85)
→ +50 fame, +170 total fanbase
→ Regional fanbase grows:
   - USA: +90 fans (60%)
   - Latin America: +15 fans (neighbor)
   - Europe: +8 fans (viral)
   - Others: smaller amounts

Each Day:
→ Song generates 10,000 new streams
→ Streams distributed across regions:
   - USA: 5,500 streams
   - Europe: 2,000 streams
   - Latin America: 1,200 streams
   - Others: 1,300 streams
→ Royalty payment: $35.70 (from both platforms)
→ Check Charts → See position in each region!
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Create new account and release a song
- [ ] Wait 1 game day, check if money increases (royalty payment)
- [ ] Check Charts screen loads without errors
- [ ] Verify song appears on Global chart
- [ ] Check regional tabs show correct data

### Regional Mechanics
- [ ] Release song in USA, verify USA fanbase grows most
- [ ] Travel to Europe, release another song
- [ ] Verify both songs have different regional distributions
- [ ] Check spillover to neighboring regions works

### Chart UI
- [ ] Verify Top 3 songs have medals
- [ ] Check your songs are highlighted
- [ ] Test tapping on your charting songs
- [ ] Verify genre badges show correct colors
- [ ] Check "Your Charting Songs" section appears

### Royalty Payments
- [ ] Release song on Tunify only → Check payment rate
- [ ] Release song on Maple Music only → Check payment rate
- [ ] Release on both platforms → Verify combined payment
- [ ] Compare payment to expected: `(streams × reach × rate)`

### Edge Cases
- [ ] Release song with no platforms selected (shouldn't happen but test)
- [ ] Check charts with no songs released
- [ ] Verify charts load for regions with 0 streams
- [ ] Test with 10+ songs released

## 💡 Implementation Notes

### Why Daily Royalties?
- **More Realistic:** Real streaming platforms pay monthly/quarterly
- **Better Game Economy:** Steady income stream vs lump sum
- **Player Engagement:** Rewards long-term success, not just release hype
- **Skill-Based:** Better songs = more streams = more money over time

### Regional Distribution Benefits
- **Geographic Strategy:** Choose release location wisely
- **Replayability:** Different strategies per region
- **Cultural Authenticity:** Hip Hop thrives in USA (1.5x), Drill in UK (1.5x)
- **Discovery Mechanism:** Players learn about music preferences globally

### Chart System Design
- **Real-time Queries:** Always shows current state (no caching)
- **Scalable:** Firestore queries optimized with where + orderBy
- **Fair:** Uses regionalStreams per region, not total
- **Competitive:** See where you rank against other players

## 🐛 Known Issues / Warnings

### Non-Critical Warnings (Can Ignore)
- `dashboard_screen_new.dart`: Unused helper methods (`_getMonthName`, `_buildStatusBlock`, etc.)
  - These are legacy methods, safe to remove but don't affect functionality

### Potential Issues
1. **Chart Loading Speed:** 
   - May slow down with 1000+ players
   - Solution: Add Firestore composite indexes
   - Consider pagination for large charts

2. **Regional Streams Initialization:**
   - Songs released before this update have empty `regionalStreams`
   - Solution: Add migration in `_loadUserProfile()` to backfill

3. **Firebase Query Limits:**
   - Firestore has 1 query/second limit on free tier
   - 8 charts × multiple refreshes = potential throttling
   - Solution: Cache results or upgrade Firebase plan
