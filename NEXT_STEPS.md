# üéØ Next Immediate Actions Required

## Current Status: ‚úÖ Code Migration Complete

All code changes have been successfully completed! The Flutter project has been renamed from `mobile_game` to `nextwave`, and all package names have been updated.

## üö® ACTION REQUIRED: Complete These 2 Steps

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Rename the Directory (2 minutes)

The code is updated, but the folder is still named `mobile_game`. 

**Choose ONE method:**

**Method A - File Explorer (Easiest):**
1. Close VS Code completely
2. Open File Explorer
3. Go to: `C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave\`
4. Right-click the `mobile_game` folder
5. Select "Rename"
6. Type: `nextwave`
7. Press Enter
8. Reopen the project in VS Code from the new `nextwave` folder

**Method B - PowerShell:**
```powershell
# Close VS Code first, then run:
cd "C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave"
Rename-Item -Path "mobile_game" -NewName "nextwave"
code nextwave
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Step 2: Update Firebase Configuration (5 minutes)

Your `google-services.json` still points to the old package name `com.example.mobile_game`. You need to add the new package to Firebase.

**Option A - Firebase Console (Recommended):**

1. **Open Firebase Console:**
   - Go to: https://console.firebase.google.com/project/nextwave-music-sim

2. **Add New Android App:**
   - Click ‚öôÔ∏è (Settings) ‚Üí Project Settings
   - Scroll to "Your apps" section
   - Click "Add app" ‚Üí Select Android (üì±)
   - Enter package name: `com.nextwave.musicgame`
   - Enter app nickname: "NextWave Music Game"
   - Click "Register app"
   - Download the new `google-services.json`

3. **Replace Configuration Files:**
   ```powershell
   # After downloading, replace these files:
   # Copy downloaded google-services.json to:
   # - C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave\nextwave\android\app\google-services.json
   # - C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave\nextwave\google-services.json
   ```

4. **Update firebase_options.dart:**
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave\nextwave"
   flutterfire configure
   # Select: nextwave-music-sim
   # Select platforms: android, ios (use arrow keys and spacebar)
   ```

**Option B - Keep Testing with Old Config (Temporary):**

If you want to test first before updating Firebase, the old configuration will still work, but you'll need to update it before publishing to production.

## üì± Step 3: Test Everything (5 minutes)

After completing Steps 1 & 2:

```powershell
# Navigate to renamed directory
cd "C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave\nextwave"

# Clean and get dependencies
flutter clean
flutter pub get

# Run the app
flutter run
```
