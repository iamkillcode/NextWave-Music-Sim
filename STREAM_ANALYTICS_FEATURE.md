## üìä Stream Calculation Formula (As Displayed)

```
Base Streams = Fame √ó Quality √ó Platform Multiplier

Daily Growth = Previous Streams √ó (1 + Quality/100)

Decay Factor = Streams √ó 0.85 (if no new release)

Estimated Next Day = Current √ó Growth Factor √ó Fame Factor
```

Where:
- Growth Factor = 1 + (Quality / 200)
- Fame Factor = 1 + (Fame / 1000)

## üéØ Use Cases

### Scenario 1: Player Complaint
**Problem:** "My song only has 50 streams, why?"

**Solution:**
1. Go to Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Debug Song Streams"
3. Enter player ID and song ID
4. See exactly why:
   - Low quality score
   - Low fame
   - Basic platform
   - New artist (low fanbase)

**Solution:**
1. Go to "View Top Streaming Songs"

3. Verify quality/fame correlation
4. Adjust if needed

2. Enter player ID
3. Review all songs and streams

## üí° Tips & Best Practices

### For Debugging

1. **Always start with song details**
   - Verify song is actually released
   - Check release date (recent = higher streams)
   - Confirm quality score is reasonable

2. **Look at artist stats**
   - Fame is the biggest multiplier
   - Fanbase affects baseline
   - Skills affect quality

3. **Platform matters**
   - Beats247 = basic (1x multiplier)
   - Tunify = better (fame requirement)
   - Maple = best (highest fame requirement)

4. **Check time factors**
   - New releases get boost
   - Old songs decay over time
   - Consistency helps maintain streams

### For Balance Testing

1. **Compare similar artists**
   - Same fame level
   - Same quality songs
   - Should have similar streams

2. **Verify formulas**
   - Use estimation feature
   - Compare with actual next-day results
   - Adjust multipliers if needed

3. **Monitor extremes**
   - Songs with 0 streams (why?)
   - Songs with 10K+ streams (legitimate?)
   - Outliers need investigation
