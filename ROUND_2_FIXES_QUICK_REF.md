## Code Changes

### Account Deletion - settings_screen.dart
```dart
// NEW: Password confirmation dialog
Future<String?> _showPasswordDialog() async {
  // Shows password input
  // Returns password or null
}

// UPDATED: Re-authentication before deletion
Future<void> _deleteAccount() async {
  final password = await _showPasswordDialog();
  if (password == null) return;
  
  // Re-authenticate
  final credential = EmailAuthProvider.credential(
    email: user.email!,
    password: password,
  );
  await user.reauthenticateWithCredential(credential);
  
  // Delete data
  await _firestore.collection('players').doc(userId).delete();
  await user.delete();
}
```

**New Error Messages:**
- `wrong-password` → "Incorrect password. Account deletion cancelled."
- `requires-recent-login` → "Session expired. Please log out and log back in."
- `user-mismatch` → "Credential mismatch. Please try again."
- `invalid-credential` → "Invalid password. Please try again."

### Date Format - game_time_service.dart
```dart
// Line ~85
String formatGameDate(DateTime gameDate) {
  return DateFormat('MMM d, yyyy').format(gameDate); // Changed: MMMM → MMM
}
```

**Output:**
- Before: "January 1, 2020" (16 chars)
- After: "Jan 1, 2020" (11 chars)

## Account Deletion Flow

1. User clicks "DELETE ACCOUNT" button
2. **First Dialog:** Warning about permanent deletion
   - CANCEL → Stops process
   - DELETE FOREVER → Continues
3. **Second Dialog:** Password confirmation
   - CANCEL → Stops process
   - CONFIRM with password → Continues
4. Re-authenticate with password
5. Delete Firestore player data
6. Delete Firebase Auth account
7. Navigate to auth screen

**Security:** Two confirmations + password required

## Testing Guide

6. Verify Firestore data deleted
7. Verify can't login with deleted account

### Test Date Formatting

## Artist Image Upload

**Location:** Settings → Account Card → Profile Avatar

**UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────┐

│    └─────┘          │
│    Artist Name      │
│    email@email.com  │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**How It Works:**
- Click camera icon
- Select image (max 512x512)
- Image converts to base64
- Saved to Firestore `avatarUrl`
- Displays across app
- Fallback: Shows initial if no image

**Already Implemented:** No changes needed!
