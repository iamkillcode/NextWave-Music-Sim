# 💰 Starting Money Standardization - Complete!

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ FIXED

---

## 🎯 Problem Fixed

### Issue
Starting money was inconsistent across the codebase:
- Onboarding: $500
- Dashboard init: $500  
- Dashboard fallback: $1000 ❌ MISMATCH

### Impact
Players who experienced profile loading errors would get $1000 instead of $500, creating an unfair advantage.

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### Standardized to $1000 Everywhere

All locations now use **$1000** as starting money:

#### 1. **Onboarding Screen**
**File:** `lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`  
**Line:** 107

```dart
// BEFORE:
'currentMoney': 500, // Starting money - minimal budget to start career!

// AFTER:
'currentMoney': 1000, // Starting money - just starting out!
```

#### 2. **Dashboard Initial State**
**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`  
**Line:** 58

```dart
// BEFORE:
money: 500, // Starting money - just starting out with minimal budget!

// AFTER:
money: 1000, // Starting money - just starting out!
```

#### 3. **Dashboard Fallback** (Already Correct)
**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`  
**Line:** 197

```dart
// Already correct:
money: (data['currentMoney'] ?? 1000).toInt(),
```

## 📊 Why $1000?

### Reasons for Choosing $1000:

1. **Better Player Experience**
   - $1000 gives new players more room to experiment
   - Can afford basic actions without immediate pressure
   - More forgiving learning curve

2. **Matches Documentation**
   - STARTING_STATS_UPDATE.md specifies $1000
   - Consistent with documented values

3. **Game Balance**
   - Writing a song costs 0 energy (free)
   - Recording costs ~$1000 (can do once)
   - Releasing costs $5000 (need to earn more first)
   - Forces progression: write → record → earn → release

4. **Consistency**
   - Fallback was already $1000
   - Aligns all code paths

## 🎮 Game Progression with $1000

### Starting State:
```
Money: $1,000
Energy: 100
Fame: 0
Fanbase: 1
```

### Early Game Actions:

| Action | Cost | Revenue | Net |
|--------|------|---------|-----|
| **Write Song** | 20 energy | +$50-300 | ✅ Profitable |
| **Record Song** | 30 energy + $1000 | +25 XP | ❌ Costs money |
| **Practice** | 15 energy | +20 creativity | Free |
| **Release Song** | $5000 | Streams → $ | ❌ Need more money |

### Strategy:
1. Write 3-5 songs (earn $150-1500)
2. Record best songs when you have $1000+
3. Save up to $5000+
4. Release and start earning passive income

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Case 1: New Account ✅
```
1. Create new account
2. Complete onboarding
3. Check starting money → Should be $1,000
```

### Test Case 2: Profile Load ✅
```
1. Log out
2. Log back in  
3. Profile loads → Money stays $1,000
```

### Test Case 3: Profile Load Failure ✅
```
1. Force error (disconnect during load)
2. Fallback triggers → Gets $1,000 (not $500)
3. No unfair advantage ✅

- ✅ Starting money standardized (Oct 15, 2025)
- ✅ Firebase field mapping consistent
- ✅ loyalFanbase integrated everywhere

## 📚 Documentation Updates Needed

These docs should be updated to reflect $1000:

1. **STARTING_STATS_UPDATE.md** - Already correct ($1000) ✅
2. **ECONOMY_REBALANCE.md** - Update to $1000 (currently says $500)
3. **ARTIST_NAME_FIX.md** - Update outdated $5000 reference
4. **README.md** - Add starting money info if not present

## 💡 Future Considerations

### Potential Adjustments:
- **Easy Mode:** $2000 starting money
- **Normal Mode:** $1000 starting money (current)
- **Hard Mode:** $500 starting money

Could add difficulty selection in onboarding later!
