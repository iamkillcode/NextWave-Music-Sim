## 🧪 Testing Checklist

### Basic Flow
- [ ] Create crew with $5M balance

## 📝 Code Quality

### ✅ Strengths
- Clean separation of concerns (models, services, UI)
- Real-time updates via Firestore streams
- Comprehensive error handling
- Consistent naming conventions
- Full TypeScript-style types

### 🎯 Best Practices Used
- Singleton service pattern
- Stream-based reactive updates
- Form validation
- Loading states
- User feedback (snackbars)
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions

## 🐛 Known Limitations (MVP)

1. **No crew avatar upload** - Uses default icon (add in Phase 2)
2. **No crew song creation** - Models ready, UI pending
3. **No custom revenue splits** - Equal split only
4. **No shared bank deposits** - Tracked but no UI
5. **No crew search UI** - Service ready, screen pending
6. **No StarChat invite cards** - Messages sent, cards need UI
