# Global Notification System Implementation Guide

## Overview

The NextWave Music Sim now has a comprehensive notification system that allows admins to send broadcast messages to all players and provides a beautiful notification center for players to view all their notifications.

## Features Implemented

### üì± **Notification Service** (`lib/services/notification_service.dart`)
A centralized service for managing all notifications with the following capabilities:

#### Personal Notifications
- **Unread Count**: Track how many unread notifications each player has
- **Get Notifications**: Retrieve personal notifications with pagination
- **Mark as Read**: Individual or bulk mark as read
- **Delete**: Remove individual notifications or clear all read notifications
- **Real-time Streams**: Listen to notification changes in real-time

#### Global Announcements
- **System Notifications**: Admin broadcasts visible to all players
- **Persistent Storage**: Global notifications stored in `system_notifications` collection
- **Individual Distribution**: Each player receives a copy in their personal notifications

### üîî **Notifications Screen** (`lib/screens/notifications_screen.dart`)
A dedicated full-screen UI for managing notifications:

#### Two Tabs
1. **Personal Tab**
   - Shows gifts from admins, royalty payments, achievements, warnings
   - Unread badge on notifications
   - Swipe to delete
   - Tap to mark as read

2. **Announcements Tab**
   - Global admin broadcasts
   - Game updates and announcements
   - Always visible (not marked as read)

#### Features
- **Pull to Refresh**: Update notifications manually
- **Contextual Icons**: Different icons for notification types
- **Time Formatting**: "Just now", "5m ago", "2h ago", etc.
- **Empty States**: Friendly messages when no notifications
- **Bulk Actions**:
  - Mark all as read
  - Clear read notifications

### üéØ **Dashboard Integration** (`lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`)
- **Notification Bell**: Top-right corner with unread badge
- **Real-time Count**: Shows number of unread notifications
- **One-Tap Access**: Opens full notifications screen
- **Auto-Refresh**: Count updates after viewing notifications

### ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloud Functions** (`functions/index.js`)

#### `sendGlobalNotificationToPlayers`
Server-side function that distributes global notifications to all players:

```javascript
exports.sendGlobalNotificationToPlayers = functions.https.onCall(async (data, context) => {
  // Admin-only access
  await validateAdminAccess(context);
  
  // Batch creates notifications for all players
  // Handles up to 500 writes per batch
  // Returns success count
});
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Admin validation required
- ‚úÖ Batch processing (500 writes/batch for efficiency)
- ‚úÖ Creates individual notification for each player
- ‚úÖ Returns statistics (players notified, notifications sent)

### üé® **Notification Types**

| Type | Icon | Color | Use Case |
|------|------|-------|----------|
| `admin_gift` | üéÅ | Gold | Admin sent you a gift |
| `royalty_payment` | üí∞ | Green | Daily royalties from songs |
| `achievement` | üèÜ | Green | Unlocked achievement |
| `warning` | ‚ö†Ô∏è | Orange | System warnings |
| `global` | üì¢ | Cyan | Admin broadcasts |
| `info` | ‚ÑπÔ∏è | Cyan | General information |

## Usage Guide

### For Players

#### Viewing Notifications
1. Look for notification bell icon (üîî) in top-right of dashboard
2. Badge shows unread count (e.g., "3")
3. Tap bell to open Notifications screen
4. Switch between "Personal" and "Announcements" tabs

#### Managing Notifications
- **Mark as Read**: Tap unread notification
- **Delete**: Swipe left on notification (Personal only)
- **Mark All Read**: Menu button ‚Üí "Mark All as Read"
- **Clear Read**: Menu button ‚Üí "Clear Read"

### For Admins

#### Sending Global Notifications

**Via Admin Dashboard:**
1. Open Admin Dashboard
2. Click "Send Global Notification" button
3. Enter title and message
4. Click "Send"
5. Notification is instantly distributed to all players

**Behind the Scenes:**
```
Admin clicks Send
    ‚Üì
1. Creates entry in system_notifications collection
    ‚Üì
2. Calls Cloud Function sendGlobalNotificationToPlayers
    ‚Üì
3. Function gets all players from Firestore
    ‚Üì
4. Creates individual notification for each player
    ‚Üì
5. Batch commits notifications (500 at a time)
    ‚Üì
6. Players see notification in real-time
```

## Database Structure

### Player Notifications
```
players/{playerId}/notifications/{notificationId}
{
  "title": "üí∞ Daily Royalties",
  "message": "You earned $1,234 from 5,678 streams!",
  "type": "royalty_payment",
  "read": false,
  "timestamp": Timestamp,
  "data": {
    "amount": 1234,
    "streams": 5678
  }
}
```

### System Notifications
```
system_notifications/{docId}
{
  "title": "üéâ Version 2.0 Released!",
  "message": "Check out the new features...",
  "createdAt": Timestamp,
  "createdBy": "adminUID",
  "type": "global"
}
```

## Firestore Security Rules

Ensure these rules are in place:

```javascript
// Player notifications (personal)
match /players/{userId}/notifications/{notificationId} {
  // Players can read and update their own notifications
  allow read, update: if request.auth.uid == userId;
  
  // Only server (Cloud Functions) can create
  allow create: if false; // Prevent client-side creation
  
  // Players can delete their own
  allow delete: if request.auth.uid == userId;
}

// System notifications (global)
match /system_notifications/{notificationId} {
  // Everyone can read
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  
  // Only server can write
  allow write: if false; // Admin writes via Cloud Function
}
```

## Testing

### Test Global Notification Flow

1. **As Admin:**
   ```
   1. Log in as admin
   2. Open Admin Dashboard
   3. Click "Send Global Notification"
   4. Title: "üéÆ Test Notification"
   5. Message: "This is a test of the global notification system!"
   6. Click Send
   ```

2. **As Player:**
   ```
   1. Log in as regular player
   2. Look for notification bell badge (should show "1")
   3. Click bell icon
   4. See test notification in both Personal and Announcements tabs
   ```

3. **Verify in Firebase Console:**
   ```
   Check: system_notifications collection ‚Üí Should have new document
   Check: players/{playerId}/notifications ‚Üí Should have new notification
   ```

### Test Personal Notifications

The system already creates notifications for:
- ‚úÖ Admin gifts (via Cloud Function)
- ‚úÖ Daily royalties (via Cloud Function)
- ‚úÖ Real-time listener picks them up automatically

## Performance Considerations

### Batching Strategy
- Cloud Function processes 500 notifications per batch
- For 1,000 players: 2 batches (< 2 seconds)
- For 10,000 players: 20 batches (< 20 seconds)
- Scales linearly with player count

### Firestore Costs
- **Read**: Each notification view = 1 read
- **Write**: Each global notification = 1 write per player
- **Storage**: ~100 bytes per notification
- **Example**: 1,000 players √ó 1 notification = 1,000 writes

### Optimization Tips
1. **Limit Frequency**: Don't send global notifications too often
2. **Clear Old Notifications**: Use admin "Clear Old Notifications" feature
3. **Pagination**: Notification screen loads only 50 at a time
4. **Real-time**: Uses snapshot listeners (efficient)

## Future Enhancements

### Push Notifications (Not Yet Implemented)
To add Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) push notifications:

1. **Add Dependencies:**
   ```yaml
   # pubspec.yaml
   dependencies:
     firebase_messaging: ^14.0.0
   ```

2. **Request Permissions:**
   ```dart
   // In notification_service.dart
   final FirebaseMessaging _messaging = FirebaseMessaging.instance;
   
   await _messaging.requestPermission(
     alert: true,
     badge: true,
     sound: true,
   );
   ```

3. **Get FCM Token:**
   ```dart
   final token = await _messaging.getToken();
   // Store in Firestore players/{uid}/fcmToken
   ```

4. **Send from Cloud Function:**
   ```javascript
   // In sendGlobalNotificationToPlayers
   const messaging = admin.messaging();
   
   await messaging.sendToTopic('all_players', {
     notification: {
       title: title,
       body: message,
     },
   });
   ```

## Troubleshooting

### Notification Bell Shows Wrong Count
**Solution:** Pull down to refresh the dashboard

### Notifications Not showing up
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí players/{uid}/notifications
2. Verify real-time listener is active (check console logs)
3. Ensure player is logged in

### Cloud Function Fails
1. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Logs
2. Verify admin permissions (checkAdminStatus)
3. Check Firestore permissions

### Global Notification Not Distributed
1. Verify Cloud Function deployed: `firebase deploy --only functions:sendGlobalNotificationToPlayers`
2. Check function logs in Firebase Console
3. Test with small player count first

## Code Examples

### Creating a Custom Notification (Server-Side)
```javascript
// In any Cloud Function
await db.collection('players')
  .doc(playerId)
  .collection('notifications')
  .add({
    title: 'üéµ Song Went Viral!',
    message: 'Your song "Summer Vibes" reached 1M streams!',
    type: 'achievement',
    read: false,
    timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    data: {
      songId: 'song_123',
      streams: 1000000,
    },
  });
```

### Subscribing to Notifications (Client-Side)
```dart
// Already implemented in dashboard_screen_new.dart
NotificationService().notificationStream(unreadOnly: true)
  .listen((notifications) {
    print('Unread: ${notifications.length}');
  });
```
