## üéÆ Gameplay Mechanics

### Song Quality Calculation
```dart
Quality = (
  (Songwriting Skill √ó 0.35) +
  (Lyrics Skill √ó 0.25) +
  (Composition Skill √ó 0.25) +
  (Experience / 50) +
  (Inspiration / 5) +
  Genre Bonus
) √ó Effort √ó Random(0.85-1.15)
```

### Stream Growth Formula
```dart
Daily Streams = 
  Loyal Fan Streams (0.5-2 per fan) +
  Discovery Streams (decay curve) +
  Viral Streams (2-7x spikes) +
  Casual Fan Streams (quality-based)
```

### Fame Gain
```dart
Fame += (Song Quality / 100) √ó Streams √ó Platform Multiplier
```

### Skill Progression
```dart
Skill Gain = Base Gain √ó Effort √ó Genre Match √ó Quality Bonus
```
