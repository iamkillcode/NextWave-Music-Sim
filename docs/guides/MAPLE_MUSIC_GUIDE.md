## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Code Location
**File**: `lib/models/streaming_platform.dart`

```dart
static const mapleMusic = StreamingPlatform(
  id: 'maple_music',
  name: 'Maple Music',
  color: '#FC3C44', // Red like Apple Music
  emoji: '🍎',
  royaltiesPerStream: 0.01, // $0.01 per stream (higher payout)
  popularity: 65,
  description: 'Premium platform with higher royalties but smaller audience',
);
```

### Usage in Code

**Get Platform**:
```dart
final platform = StreamingPlatform.getById('maple_music');
```

**Calculate Earnings**:
```dart
for (final platformId in song.streamingPlatforms) {
  if (platformId == 'maple_music') {
    final platform = StreamingPlatform.getById(platformId);
    incomeForThisSong += streamsGained * platform.royaltiesPerStream;
  }
}
```

## 🎯 Real-World Inspiration

Maple Music is inspired by **Apple Music**, which:
- ✅ Pays higher royalties than competitors
- ✅ Has premium user base
- ✅ Smaller market share than Spotify
- ✅ Known for artist-friendly policies

---

## 📈 Income Formulas

### Tunify Formula
```dart
Income per second = (quality × fame × fanbase) × 0.003
```

### Maple Music Formula
```dart
Income per second = (quality × fame × fanbase) × 0.01
```

### Combined (Both Platforms)
```dart
Total income = Tunify earnings + Maple Music earnings
             = (base_streams × 0.003) + (base_streams × 0.01)
             = base_streams × 0.013
```

**Result**: Using both platforms gives you **4.3x** the income of Tunify alone!
