## ‚úÖ Implementation Complete

**Date**: December 2024

## üí° Design Decisions

### Why These Rules?
1. **Singles can join EPs/Albums**: Encourages players to release singles first for immediate income, then bundle them later
2. **EP songs can join Albums**: Allows progression (start with EP, upgrade to full album)
3. **Album songs are locked**: Prevents infinite reuse, maintains album integrity
4. **Scheduled album songs can be singles**: Provides flexibility and mimics real music industry (lead singles before album)

### Player Benefits:
- **Strategic Depth**: Choose between quick single releases or building toward albums
- **Flexibility**: Re-use successful singles in albums
- **Progression**: Start small (EPs) and grow to full albums
- **Revenue Optimization**: Singles for immediate income, albums for long-term value
