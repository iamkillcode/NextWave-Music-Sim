# Crew Symbol Upload Feature

## Overview
Crews can now upload custom symbols/logos that appear throughout the game wherever the crew is displayed.

## Implementation

### 1. Service Layer

**`lib/services/crew_symbol_uploader.dart`** - New service for handling crew symbol uploads
- `pickAndUploadCrewSymbol()` - Picks image from gallery and uploads to Firebase Storage
- `uploadCrewSymbolBytes()` - Uploads raw image bytes to Storage
- `deleteCrewSymbol()` - Removes old symbols when replacing

**Storage Path**: `crew-symbols/{crewId}_{hash}.jpg`
- Hash prevents caching issues when updating symbols
- Max size: 2MB
- Recommended dimensions: 512x512px
- Quality: 90%

### 2. CrewService Updates

**`lib/services/crew_service.dart`** - Added new method
- `uploadCrewSymbol()` - Updates crew's `avatarUrl` field in Firestore
- **Permission**: Leader only
- Validates user is crew leader before allowing upload

### 3. UI Integration

**`lib/screens/crew_hub_screen.dart`** - Settings Tab
- Added "Upload Crew Symbol" option in settings (leader only)
- Shows "Change crew logo" if symbol exists, "Add a crew logo" if not
- Displays loading states and success/error feedback
- Symbol automatically displays in:
  - Overview Tab (crew header with CircleAvatar)
  - Member lists
  - Anywhere `crew.avatarUrl` is rendered

### 4. Firebase Storage Rules

**`storage.rules`** - New rules for crew-symbols folder
```plaintext
match /crew-symbols/{allPaths=**} {
  allow read: if true;  // Public read for displaying logos
  allow write: if request.auth != null
               && request.resource.size < 2 * 1024 * 1024
               && request.resource.contentType.matches('image/.*');
  allow delete: if request.auth != null;
}
```

✅ **Deployed**: Rules updated and deployed successfully

## User Flow

### Uploading a Symbol (Leader Only)

1. Navigate to **Crew Hub** → **Settings** tab
2. Tap "Upload Crew Symbol"
3. Select image from gallery (system picker)
4. Image is automatically:
   - Resized to 512x512 max dimensions
   - Compressed to 90% quality
   - Uploaded to Firebase Storage
   - URL saved to crew document
5. Success message shows "✅ Crew symbol updated successfully!"

### Symbol Display

Once uploaded, the symbol appears:
- ✅ **Overview Tab** - Large avatar in crew header
- ✅ **Member Lists** - Next to crew name
