# ViralWave Time-Based Marketing System

## Overview
ViralWave has been completely overhauled to provide a realistic, time-based marketing system for promoting singles, EPs, and Albums. Players can now customize campaign duration and budget to match their strategy.

## Implementation Date
2025-01-XX

## Key Features

### 1. **Promotion Types** (Reduced from 4 to 3)
- **Song (Single Track)** - Promote one released song
- **EP** - Promote an entire EP (requires 1+ released EP)
- **Album (LP)** - Promote a full album (requires 1+ released Album)

**Removed:**
- ‚ùå "Single (1-2 songs)" option (redundant and confusing)

---

### 2. **Time-Based Campaigns**
Promotions are no longer instant - they take **in-game time** to show results.

#### Campaign Duration
- **User-selectable**: 1 to 30 in-game days
- Controlled via slider in UI
- Default: 7 days

#### Stream Accumulation
- Streams are distributed evenly across campaign duration
- Formula: `dailyStreams = totalStreams / campaignDays`
- Players see gradual, realistic growth instead of instant spikes

#### Technical Implementation
```dart
// Songs store promotion buffer and end date
Song {
  int promoBuffer;          // Streams added per day
  DateTime? promoEndDate;   // When promotion ends
}

// Example: 7-day campaign generating 14,000 streams
// ‚Üí 2,000 streams added per day for 7 days
```

---

### 3. **Custom Budget System**

#### Base Costs
- **Song**: $500 base cost
- **EP**: $2,000 base cost
- **Album (LP)**: $5,000 base cost

#### Budget Multiplier
- **Range**: 0.5x to 3.0x (controlled via slider)
- **0.5x** - Minimal budget (50% cost, 50% effectiveness)
- **1.0x** - Standard budget (base cost, normal results)
- **3.0x** - Premium budget (300% cost, 300% effectiveness)

#### Total Cost Formula
```dart
totalCost = baseCost √ó days √ó budgetMultiplier
```

#### Examples
| Type | Days | Multiplier | Calculation | Total Cost |
|------|------|------------|-------------|------------|
| Song | 7 | 1.0x | $500 √ó 7 √ó 1.0 | **$3,500** |
| Song | 14 | 2.0x | $500 √ó 14 √ó 2.0 | **$14,000** |
| EP | 10 | 1.5x | $2,000 √ó 10 √ó 1.5 | **$30,000** |
| Album | 30 | 3.0x | $5,000 √ó 30 √ó 3.0 | **$450,000** |

---

### 4. **Cover Art Display**

All promotion selectors now show **cover art thumbnails** for visual recognition.

#### Song Selector
```dart
// Shows cover art if available
if (song.coverArtUrl != null) {
  CachedNetworkImage(
    imageUrl: song.coverArtUrl,
    width: 50,
    height: 50,
    fit: BoxFit.cover,
  );
} else {
  // Fallback: Music note icon
  Icon(Icons.music_note);
}
```

#### EP/Album Selector
- Displays album cover art from `Album.coverArtUrl`
- Shows EP/Album title and song count
- Fallback icon if no cover art uploaded

---

### 5. **Number Formatting**

All large numbers now use **comma separators** for readability.

#### Applied To:
- Fanbase count: `1,234,567`
- Money amounts: `$45,000`
- Stream counts: `2,500 streams/day`
- Total cost: `$3,500`

#### Implementation
```dart
import 'package:intl/intl.dart';

final formatter = NumberFormat('#,###');
Text(formatter.format(widget.artistStats.fanbase));
```

---

### 6. **Campaign Summary Display**

When configuring a campaign, players see **detailed projections**:

| Metric | Description | Example |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Total Cost** | Final cost with duration & budget | $14,000 |
| **Duration** | Campaign length | 14 in-game days |
| **Budget Level** | Multiplier applied | 2.0x |
| **Potential Reach** | Estimated audience size | 25,000 people |
| **Estimated Fans** | New fanbase gain | +3,750 fans |
| **Daily Streams** | Streams added per day | +1,000 streams/day |
| **Total Streams** | Cumulative streams | +14,000 streams |
| **Fame Boost** | Immediate fame gain | +6 fame |

---

### 7. **Launch Dialog Updates**

After launching a campaign, the dialog shows:

```
üéâ Campaign Launched!

Your campaign for "Neon Nights" is now active!

üìÖ Duration: 14 in-game days
üë• Expected Fans: +3,750
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Daily Streams: +1,000/day
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Total Streams: +14,000
‚≠ê Fame Boost: +6

‚ÑπÔ∏è Streams will accumulate gradually over 14 days
```

**Key Changes:**
- Shows campaign is **active** (not instant)
- Displays **daily stream rate** (not just total)
- Informs player streams are **gradual**
