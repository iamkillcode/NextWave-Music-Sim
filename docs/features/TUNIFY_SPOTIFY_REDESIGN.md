## 🎯 Key Features

### Dynamic Artist Initials
```dart
String _getArtistInitials() {
  final words = _currentStats.name.trim().split(' ');
  if (words.length >= 2) {
    return '${words[0][0]}${words[1][0]}'.toUpperCase();
  }
  return _currentStats.name.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase();
}
```

Examples:
- "Taylor Swift" → "TS"
- "Drake" → "D"
- "The Weeknd" → "TW"

### Dynamic Color Generation
```dart
Color _getArtistColor() {
  final hash = _currentStats.name.hashCode.abs();
  return colors[hash % colors.length];
}
```

Each artist gets a consistent color based on their name!

### Revenue Tracking
Each song now shows:
- Stream count with play icon
- Revenue in Spotify green: `$X.XX`
- Platform badges
