# Charts System Implementation - Complete Summary

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Core Implementation Complete

---

## ✅ Issues Fixed

### 1. TypeError: Null is not a subtype of Song ✅
**Problem:** Regional charts crashed when trying to cast `null` to `Song` object.

**Root Cause:** Service returned `Map<String, dynamic>` with flat structure, but UI expected nested structure with `song` key containing Song object.

**Solution:** 
- Updated `regional_charts_screen.dart` line 250 to extract data directly from flat map
- Changed from: `final song = songData['song'] as Song;`
- Changed to: Direct extraction of `title`, `artist`, `genre`, `streams` from map
- Updated all UI references to use extracted variables

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/regional_charts_screen.dart`

---

### 2. Released Songs Not Showing in Charts ✅
**Problem:** Unreleased songs (writing, recording state) appearing in charts.

**Solution:**
- Added filter: `songState == 'released'` in `RegionalChartService.getTopSongsByRegion()`
- Added same filter in `RegionalChartService.getGlobalChart()`
- Only released songs now appear on all charts

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/regional_chart_service.dart`

---

### 3. Spotlight 200 Chart (Albums Only) ✅
**Feature:** New chart system for albums.

**Implementation:**
- Created `SpotlightChartService` with `getSpotlight200()` method
- Filters: `isAlbum == true` AND `state == 'released'`
- Sorts by `totalStreams` descending
- Top 200 albums displayed
- Gold theme color (#FFD700)

**Files Created:**
- `lib/services/spotlight_chart_service.dart`
- `lib/screens/spotlight_charts_screen.dart`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/song.dart` - Added `isAlbum` field

---

### 4. Spotlight Hot 100 Chart (Singles with 7-Day Rolling Window) ✅
**Feature:** Singles chart ranked by recent performance.

**Key Insight:** Hot 100 doesn't filter out old songs - it ranks ALL singles by their streams gained in the last 7 game days.

**Implementation:**
- Added `last7DaysStreams` field to Song model
- `getSpotlightHot100()` method ranks by `last7DaysStreams`
- Filters: `isAlbum == false` AND `state == 'released'` AND `last7DaysStreams > 0`
- Shows top 100 singles with best recent performance
- Orange-red theme color (#FF4500)
- Info banner explains 7-day ranking system

**How It Works:**
```
Song A: 1,000,000 total streams, 5,000 last 7 days → Ranks by 5,000
Song B: 50,000 total streams, 10,000 last 7 days → Ranks by 10,000
Result: Song B ranks higher (more recent activity)
```

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/song.dart` - Added `last7DaysStreams` field
- `lib/services/spotlight_chart_service.dart`
- `lib/screens/spotlight_charts_screen.dart`

---

### 5. Regional Charts Alignment with Spotlight ✅
**Feature:** Unified chart UI/UX across all chart types.

**Consistency:**
- Medal system (gold/silver/bronze) for top 3
- Genre color coding
- Stream formatting (1K, 1M notation)
- User songs highlighted with colored borders
- Trending indicators for top performers
- Same data structure from services

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/regional_charts_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/spotlight_charts_screen.dart`

---

## 📊 New Song Model Fields

### `isAlbum` (bool)
- **Purpose:** Distinguish albums from singles for Spotlight charts
- **Default:** `false` (singles)
- **Usage:** Spotlight 200 shows `isAlbum: true`, Hot 100 shows `isAlbum: false`
- **Integration:** Fully serialized (toJson/fromJson)

### `last7DaysStreams` (int)
- **Purpose:** Track streams gained in last 7 game days for Hot 100
- **Default:** `0`
- **Usage:** Hot 100 ranks by this field instead of totalStreams
- **Update Strategy:** Needs implementation in stream growth service (see next steps)
- **Integration:** Fully serialized (toJson/fromJson)

## 🎯 Chart Types Summary

### Regional Charts (Existing, Fixed)
- **Types:** 7 regions + Global
- **Filter:** `state == 'released'` AND `regionalStreams[region] > 0`
- **Sort:** By regional streams (descending)
- **Shows:** All songs (albums + singles)

### Spotlight 200 (New)
- **Type:** Global albums chart
- **Filter:** `state == 'released'` AND `isAlbum == true` AND `totalStreams > 0`
- **Sort:** By total streams (descending)
- **Shows:** Top 200 albums

### Spotlight Hot 100 (New)
- **Type:** Global singles chart with rolling window
- **Filter:** `state == 'released'` AND `isAlbum == false` AND `last7DaysStreams > 0`
- **Sort:** By last 7 days streams (descending)
- **Shows:** Top 100 singles with best recent performance
- **Special:** Naturally "resets" as old streams drop off

## ⏳ Next Steps Required

### Critical: Implement `last7DaysStreams` Updates
The Hot 100 chart is ready, but you need to update your stream growth service to maintain the `last7DaysStreams` field.

**Where to Implement:**
1. **Stream Distribution** - When adding daily streams to a song:
   ```dart
   updatedSong = song.copyWith(
     streams: song.streams + newStreams,
     last7DaysStreams: song.last7DaysStreams + newStreams, // ADD THIS
   );
   ```

2. **Daily Decay Task** - Once per game day, reduce old streams:
   ```dart
   // Remove 1/7th of streams (one day drops off the 7-day window)
   updatedSong = song.copyWith(
     last7DaysStreams: (song.last7DaysStreams * 0.857).round(),
   );
   ```

**See:** `HOT_100_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md` for detailed implementation options

---

### Optional: Add Navigation to Spotlight Charts

In your main navigation (dashboard, menu, etc.):

```dart
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () {
    Navigator.push(
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const SpotlightChartsScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },
  child: Text('Spotlight Charts'),
)
```

---

### Optional: Add Album/Single Selection in Song Creation

Allow users to choose whether their song is an album or single:

```dart
bool _isAlbum = false;

SwitchListTile(
  title: Text('Release as Album'),
  subtitle: Text(_isAlbum ? 'Spotlight 200' : 'Hot 100 Eligible'),
  value: _isAlbum,
  onChanged: (value) => setState(() => _isAlbum = value),
)

// Then use _isAlbum when creating the song
final newSong = Song(
  // ... other fields
  isAlbum: _isAlbum,
);
```

---

### Optional: Daily/Weekly Regional Charts

The architecture is in place to add:
- Daily regional charts (songs charting in last game day)
- Weekly regional charts (songs charting in last 7 game days)

Similar approach to Hot 100 - would need daily/weekly stream tracking per region.

---

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### Test Regional Charts
1. Navigate to Regional Charts
2. Verify only released songs appear
3. Confirm no TypeError occurs
4. Check songs are sorted by regional streams
5. Verify user's songs are highlighted

### Test Spotlight 200
1. Create and release an album (set `isAlbum: true`)
2. Navigate to Spotlight Charts → Spotlight 200 tab
3. Verify album appears on chart
4. Confirm singles don't appear on this chart
5. Check sorting by total streams

### Test Hot 100
1. Create and release a single (set `isAlbum: false`)
2. Add streams and update `last7DaysStreams` field
3. Navigate to Spotlight Charts → Hot 100 tab
4. Verify single appears on chart
5. Confirm ranking by 7-day streams (not total)
6. Info banner should explain the system

### Test Edge Cases
- Song with `last7DaysStreams: 0` should not appear on Hot 100
- Album should not appear on Hot 100 (even if single flag not set)
- Single should not appear on Spotlight 200
- Charts should handle empty states gracefully

## 📊 Data Flow

```
Firebase Firestore
  └─ players collection
      └─ songs array
          ├─ state: 'released'
          ├─ isAlbum: true/false
          ├─ totalStreams: int
          ├─ last7DaysStreams: int
          └─ regionalStreams: Map<String, int>

↓ Query by Service

RegionalChartService / SpotlightChartService
  ├─ Filter by state, isAlbum, streams
  ├─ Sort by appropriate stream count
  └─ Return List<Map<String, dynamic>>

↓ Display in UI

Charts Screen (FutureBuilder)
  ├─ Loading indicator
  ├─ Error handling
  ├─ Empty state
  └─ Chart entries with medals and highlighting
```
