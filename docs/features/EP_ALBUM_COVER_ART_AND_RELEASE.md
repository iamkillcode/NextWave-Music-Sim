**Status**: Fully Implemented & Multiplayer-Ready

---

## 🎯 Features Implemented

### 1. ✅ Album/EP Cover Art Upload

### 2. ✅ Smart Cover Art Inheritance
**RULE:** When releasing an EP/Album:

- **Songs WITHOUT cover art** (unreleased) → Use the album's cover art ✅

**Example:**
```
Album: "Summer Vibes" (has album cover art 🌅)
  ├─ Song 1: "Heat Wave" (already released single with its own art 🔥) → Keeps 🔥
  ├─ Song 2: "Sunset Dreams" (unreleased, no art) → Gets 🌅
  └─ Song 3: "Beach Party" (unreleased, no art) → Gets 🌅
```

### 3. ✅ Album Release Functionality
- **Release Now** button fully functional
- Marks album as `AlbumState.released`
- Releases all songs in the album instantly
- Applies cover art inheritance rules
- Fame & fanbase bonuses based on album quality
- Success dialog with stats breakdown

### 4. ✅ Firebase Persistence (Multiplayer-Ready)
- Albums saved to Firebase via `FirebaseService().updatePlayerStats()`
- Albums loaded in `_loadUserProfile()` on login
- Albums loaded in real-time listener for instant sync
- Albums persist across sessions
- **Albums no longer vanish** after creation

    final albumsList = data['albums'] as List<dynamic>;
    loadedAlbums = albumsList
        .map((albumData) => Album.fromJson(Map<String, dynamic>.from(albumData)))
        .toList();
  }
  ```
- Pass `albums: loadedAlbums` to `ArtistStats` constructor

  ```dart
  List<Album> loadedAlbums = [];

    // ... same loading logic
  }
  ```

## 🎮 How It Works (User Flow)

### Creating an Album/EP with Cover Art:
1. Dashboard → Click "Releases" button
2. Click "Create New" tab
3. Choose type: EP (3-6 songs) or Album (7+ songs)
4. Enter album title
5. **NEW:** Upload cover art (optional)
   - Click "Upload" button
   - Select image from device
   - Preview appears
   - Can change or remove
6. Select songs (recorded or released singles)
7. Click "Create EP/Album"
8. Album saved to "Scheduled" tab

### Releasing an Album/EP:
1. Go to "Scheduled" tab
2. Find your album/EP
3. Click "Release Now" button
4. **System applies smart cover art inheritance**:
   - Singles keep their art
   - Unreleased songs use album art
5. All songs released instantly
6. Fame & fanbase bonuses applied
7. Success dialog shows results
8. Album moves to "Released" tab

## 📊 Cover Art Logic (Multiplayer-Safe)

### Smart Inheritance Algorithm:
```dart
for each song in album:
  if song.coverArtUrl != null:
    // Song already has cover art (was released as single)
    keep song.coverArtUrl  // Don't overwrite!
  else if album.coverArtUrl != null:
    // Song has no art, but album does
    song.coverArtUrl = album.coverArtUrl  // Inherit album art
  else:
    // Neither has art
    song.coverArtUrl = null  // Use fallback icon in UI
```

**Why this matters:**
- **Player A** releases "Song X" as single with custom art
- **Player A** later adds "Song X" to an album
- **Song X** keeps its original art (doesn't get replaced)
- Other album songs without art use the album's art

---

## 🎯 Stats & Bonuses

### Album Release Bonuses:
```dart
avgQuality = average of all songs' quality scores
fameGain = 5 + (avgQuality / 20)  // 5-10 fame
fanbaseGain = 100 + (fameGain * 20)  // 200-300 fans
```

**Example:**
- Album with 4 songs: 80, 85, 75, 90 quality
- Average quality: 82.5
- Fame gain: 5 + (82/20) = 9 fame ⭐
- Fanbase gain: 100 + (9 * 20) = 280 fans 👥

## 📝 Known Behaviors

### Expected:
- Albums saved to Firebase every ~500ms (debounced)
- Albums load on app start (from Firebase)
- Albums sync in real-time (via snapshots)
- Cover art stored as base64 data URLs (inline in Firebase)
- Released albums appear in "Released" tab permanently

### Edge Cases Handled:
- Album creation without cover art → Works fine
- Releasing album without songs → Prevented by validation
- Song already has cover art → Art is preserved
- Album has no art, songs have no art → Fallback icons used
- Multiple releases of same song → Original cover art never overwritten
