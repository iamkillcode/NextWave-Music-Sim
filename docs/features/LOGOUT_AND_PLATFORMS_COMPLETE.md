# ✅ Implementation Complete - Logout & Streaming Platforms

## Summary of Changes

### 1. 🔐 **Logout Functionality - FIXED**
**Problem**: Logout button was calling non-existent route  
**Solution**: Added named routes to `lib/main.dart`

```dart
routes: {
  '/auth': (context) => const AuthScreen(),
  '/dashboard': (context) => const DashboardScreen(),
}
```

**Result**: 
- ✅ Logout now works correctly
- ✅ Delete account redirects properly
- ✅ Clean navigation flow

---

### 2. 🎵 **Dual Streaming Platform System**

#### **Tunify** (Spotify-style)
- 💚 Green branding
- 💰 $0.003 per stream
- 📊 85% popularity
- 🎯 Best for: Maximum audience reach

#### **Maple Music** (Apple Music-style)  
- ❤️ Red branding
- 💰 $0.01 per stream (3.3x higher!)
- 📊 65% popularity
- 🎯 Best for: Premium earnings

---

### 3. 🎮 **Game Strategy**

**Trade-off System:**
- **Tunify**: Lower royalties × Higher popularity = More total streams
- **Maple Music**: Higher royalties × Lower popularity = Better per-stream pay

**Example with 1M streams:**
- Tunify: 1,000,000 streams × $0.003 = **$3,000**
- Maple Music: 650,000 streams × $0.01 = **$6,500**
