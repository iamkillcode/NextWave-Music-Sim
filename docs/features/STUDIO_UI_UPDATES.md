2. `getAttitude()` - O(n) where n = number of songs
3. `getAdjustedPrice()` - O(1)
4. `getAttitudeQualityModifier()` - O(1)

**Total complexity per card**: O(n) - Acceptable for typical song counts (10-50)

### Optimization Notes
- Calculations only happen during build
- No heavy computations in hot paths
- Attitude/price cached during single build
- No network calls or async operations
