# Custom Cover Art Upload Feature

## ‚úÖ Changes Made

### **1. Cover Art Upload System** üì∏
- Players can now upload their own images as cover art
- Two modes: **Generate** (AI-style) or **Upload Image** (custom)
- Easy toggle between modes with clear visual feedback
- Works with web platform using browser file picker

### **2. Upload Button UI** üé®

**New Toggle Buttons:**
```
[Generate] [Upload Image]
   ‚Üì           ‚Üì
 Cyan      Gray (default)
```

When you click "Upload Image":
- Opens browser file picker
- Accepts all image formats (PNG, JPG, GIF, etc.)
- Shows preview immediately
- Hides style/color selectors (not needed for custom art)

### **3. Cover Art Preview** üñºÔ∏è

**Generated Mode:**
- Shows gradient background with color theme
- Displays genre emoji
- Shows song title and artist name
- Style and color customization visible

**Uploaded Mode:**
- Shows your uploaded image
- Fills the entire 200x200 preview
- No overlays or text (clean custom art)
- Image fits nicely with rounded corners

### **4. Data Model Updates** üóÇÔ∏è

**Song Model - New Field:**
```dart
final String? coverArtUrl; // Stores uploaded image URL
```

**Smart Storage:**
- If custom art: Saves `coverArtUrl`, nulls style/color
- If generated: Saves style/color, nulls `coverArtUrl`
- Only stores what's actually being used

## How It Works

### **Upload Flow:**
1. Click "Upload Image" button
2. Browser file picker opens
3. Select image from computer
4. Image converts to data URL
5. Preview updates immediately
6. Release song with custom cover art saved

### **Technical Implementation:**

**File Upload:**
```dart
final uploadInput = html.FileUploadInputElement();
uploadInput.accept = 'image/*';
uploadInput.click();

// Read as data URL
final reader = html.FileReader();
reader.readAsDataUrl(files[0]);
reader.onLoadEnd.listen((e) {
  setState(() {
    _uploadedCoverArtUrl = reader.result as String?;
    _useCustomCoverArt = true;
  });
});
```

**Conditional Rendering:**
```dart
image: _useCustomCoverArt && _uploadedCoverArtUrl != null
    ? DecorationImage(
        image: NetworkImage(_uploadedCoverArtUrl!),
        fit: BoxFit.cover,
      )
    : null,
```

## UI Changes

### **Before:**
```
[Cover Art Preview]
Style: üé® Minimalist
Color: [Cyan] [Pink] [Purple] ...
```

### **After:**
```
