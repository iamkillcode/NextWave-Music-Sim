## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### 1. New Song Model Fields

#### `lastDayStreams` (Integer)
- **Purpose:** Tracks streams gained in the last game day
- **Default:** `0`
- **Updated:** Replaced daily with new value
- **Used For:** Daily charts

```dart
final int lastDayStreams; // Streams gained yesterday
```

#### Updated: `last7DaysStreams` (Integer)
- **Purpose:** Tracks streams gained in the last 7 game days
- **Default:** `0`
- **Updated:** Rolling addition, decay every day
- **Used For:** Weekly charts

```dart
final int last7DaysStreams; // Streams gained in last 7 days
```

### 2. Stream Tracking Logic

#### Daily Tracking
```dart
// Each game day:
1. Reset lastDayStreams to 0
2. Calculate new daily streams
3. Set lastDayStreams = todayStreams
4. Add todayStreams to last7DaysStreams
```

#### Weekly Tracking
```dart
// Each game day:
1. Decay last7DaysStreams by ~14.3% (one day drops off)
2. Add today's streams
3. Result: Rolling 7-day window
```

### 3. Service Architecture

#### UnifiedChartService
**File:** `lib/services/unified_chart_service.dart`

**Methods:**
```dart
// Get songs chart (singles or albums)
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getSongsChart({
  required String period,      // 'daily' or 'weekly'
  required String type,         // 'singles' or 'albums'
  required String region,       // 'global' or region code
  int limit = 100,
})

// Get artists chart
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getArtistsChart({
  required String period,       // 'daily' or 'weekly'
  required String region,       // 'global' or region code
  int limit = 100,
  String sortBy = 'streams',    // 'streams', 'songs', or 'fanbase'
})

// Get chart position for a song
Future<int?> getSongChartPosition({
  required String songTitle,
  required String artistId,
  required String period,
  required String type,
  required String region,
})

// Get chart position for an artist
Future<int?> getArtistChartPosition({
  required String artistId,
  required String period,
  required String region,
  String sortBy = 'streams',
})
```

### 4. UI Implementation

**File:** `lib/screens/unified_charts_screen.dart`

**Features:**
- Three-tier filter system (Period/Type/Region)
- Segmented buttons for Period and Type
- Dropdown selector for Region

## 📈 How It Works

### Daily Charts

**Concept:** Who's hot TODAY?

**Example:**
- **Classic Hit:** Released 2 years ago, 10M total streams
  - Yesterday's streams: 5K
  - **Daily Chart Position:** Ranked by 5K

- **Viral New Song:** Released yesterday, 50K total streams
  - Yesterday's streams: 50K
  - **Daily Chart Position:** Ranked by 50K → Beats the classic!

**Result:** New viral hits dominate daily charts 🔥

### Weekly Charts

**Concept:** Who's trending THIS WEEK?

**Mechanism:**
- Rolling 7-day window
- Each day, oldest day drops off (~14.3% decay)
- New streams added
- Songs can re-enter if they go viral again

**Example:**
- **Day 1:** Release day → 100K streams → Chart position: #1
- **Day 2:** +50K streams → 7-day total: 150K
- **Day 3:** +30K streams → 7-day total: 180K
- **Day 8:** Oldest day drops off → Decay + new streams
- **Day 30:** May drop off if no new streams, OR climb back if viral moment

**Result:** Dynamic rankings reflecting current trends 📊

### Artist Charts

**New Feature:** Rank artists by combined performance

**Metrics:**
- **Primary:** Total streams across all songs (daily or weekly)
- **Secondary:** Number of released songs
- **Tertiary:** Fanbase size

**Display:**
- Artist name
- Period streams (daily or weekly)
- Total fanbase
- Number of released songs
- Chart position

## 🔍 Regional Distribution

### How Regional Charts Work

When filtering by region, the system:
1. Checks if song has streams in that region
2. Calculates regional proportion of recent streams
3. Ranks by regional streams only

**Example:**
```
Song: "Global Hit"
- Total streams: 1M
- USA streams: 400K (40%)
- Europe streams: 300K (30%)
- Other: 300K (30%)

Weekly Chart (last 7 days: 100K total streams)
- USA Weekly Chart: 40K streams (40% of 100K)
- Europe Weekly Chart: 30K streams (30% of 100K)
```

- **Regional Chart:** Same as global (single query)

### Resource Usage

- **Memory:** Minimal increase (~20 bytes per song for new fields)
- **CPU:** Negligible (simple arithmetic)
- **Database:** No additional queries vs old system
- **Network:** Same bandwidth as before
