## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **SideHustle Model**:
```dart
class SideHustle {
  final String id;
  final SideHustleType type;
  final int dailyPay;
  final int dailyEnergyCost;
  final int contractLengthDays;
  final DateTime? startDate;
  final DateTime? endDate;
  final bool isAvailable;
  
  // Helper methods:
  int daysRemaining(DateTime currentDate);
  bool isExpired(DateTime currentDate);
  String get qualityRating;
  int get qualityColor;
}
```

### **SideHustleService Methods**:
- `generateNewContracts(int count)` - Generate random contracts
- `getAvailableContracts()` - Stream of available contracts
- `claimContract(String id, DateTime date)` - Claim with transaction
- `removeExpiredContracts()` - Cleanup old contracts
- `initializeContractPool()` - Initialize on first launch
- `applyDailySideHustle(...)` - Apply daily effects

### **Daily Update Logic**:
```dart
void _applyDailyStreamGrowth(DateTime currentGameDate) {
  // ... existing stream growth logic ...
  
  // 💼 Apply side hustle effects
  if (artistStats.activeSideHustle != null) {
    final result = _sideHustleService.applyDailySideHustle(
      sideHustle: artistStats.activeSideHustle!,
      currentMoney: artistStats.money + totalNewIncome,
      currentEnergy: artistStats.energy,
      currentGameDate: currentGameDate,
    );
    
    sideHustlePay = result['money']! - (artistStats.money + totalNewIncome);
    sideHustleEnergyCost = (artistStats.energy - result['energy']!).round();
    sideHustleExpired = result['expired'] == 1;
    
    // Deduct energy and add pay
    artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
      energy: artistStats.energy - sideHustleEnergyCost,
      money: artistStats.money + totalNewIncome + sideHustlePay,
      clearSideHustle: sideHustleExpired,
    );
  }
}
```

## 🎮 Player Experience

### **How It Works**:
1. **Browse Contracts**: Tap "Side Hustle" on dashboard
2. **View Details**: See pay, energy cost, contract length
3. **Claim Contract**: First-come, first-served from shared pool
4. **Earn Money**: Automatically receive daily pay
5. **Energy Cost**: Energy deducted every game day
6. **Contract Ends**: Auto-expires after contract length
7. **Terminate Early**: Can quit any time

### **Strategic Considerations**:
- **High Energy Jobs**: More pay but tiring (e.g., Cleaning)
- **Low Energy Jobs**: Less pay but sustainable (e.g., Tutoring)
- **Contract Length**: Longer = more total earnings
- **Energy Management**: Balance with music activities
- **Quality Rating**: Better deals = more pay per energy spent

---

## 💰 Economy Balance

### **Starting Money**:
- **Previous**: $1,000
- **New**: $5,000
- **Reason**: Gives players breathing room to explore side hustles

### **Daily Earnings Range**:
- **Low**: $80-95/day (Dog Walking, Cleaning)
- **Medium**: $100-130/day (Most jobs)
- **High**: $140-150/day (Tutoring, Security)

### **Energy Costs**:
- **Low**: 8-12 energy (Tutoring, Food Delivery)
- **Medium**: 15-18 energy (Most jobs)
- **High**: 20-25 energy (Babysitting, Cleaning)

### **Typical Contract**:
- **Length**: 10-15 days
- **Total Earnings**: $1,000-2,000
- **Total Energy**: 150-250

---

## 🔥 Multiplayer Integration

### **Shared Pool**:
- Firestore collection: `side_hustle_contracts`
- All players see same contracts
- Real-time updates via Firestore streams

### **First-Come, First-Served**:
```dart
// Atomic transaction prevents race conditions
final claimedContract = await _firestore.runTransaction((transaction) async {
  final snapshot = await transaction.get(docRef);
  if (!snapshot.data()['isAvailable']) return null; // Already claimed
  
  transaction.update(docRef, {'isAvailable': false});
  return claimedContract;
});
```

### **Contract Lifecycle**:
1. **Generated**: Every game day (can be automated via Cloud Function)
2. **Available**: Visible to all players for 3 real days
3. **Claimed**: One player claims, becomes unavailable
4. **Expired**: Auto-removed after 3 days (cleanup)

---

## 🎨 UI Features

### **Active Contract Card**:
- Large emoji icon for job type
- Progress bar showing days remaining
- Daily pay and energy cost chips
- Quality rating badge
- Terminate button

### **Available Contracts List**:
- Grid layout with job icons
- Quality ratings (color-coded)
- Key stats: pay, energy, length, total
- Tap to view detailed dialog
- Disabled if player has active contract

## 🚀 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### **Potential Features**:
1. **Job Reputation**: Better contracts unlock with experience
2. **Skill Bonuses**: High skills = better pay for certain jobs
3. **Contract Negotiation**: Pay more energy for higher pay
4. **Referral System**: Players share contracts with friends
5. **Job Chains**: Complete one contract, unlock better next
6. **Regional Jobs**: Different jobs available per region
7. **Seasonal Jobs**: Holiday-themed contracts
8. **Contract History**: Track all completed side hustles
9. **Achievements**: Complete X contracts, earn rewards
10. **Daily Quota**: Generate new contracts every game day

### **Cloud Function Integration**:
```javascript
// Run every game day to generate new contracts
exports.generateSideHustleContracts = functions.pubsub
  .schedule('0 * * * *') // Every hour (1 game day)
  .onRun(async () => {
    // Generate 5-10 new random contracts
    // Remove expired contracts
    // Update Firestore
  });
```
