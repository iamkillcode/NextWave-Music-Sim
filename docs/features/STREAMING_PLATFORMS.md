# Streaming Platforms & Logout Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. ‚úÖ **Logout Functionality Fixed**
- **Issue**: Logout was calling `pushReplacementNamed('/auth')` but no named routes existed
- **Fix**: Added named routes to `lib/main.dart`
  - `/auth` ‚Üí `AuthScreen`
  - `/dashboard` ‚Üí `DashboardScreen`
- **Result**: Logout now works correctly and redirects to auth screen
- **Delete Account**: Also redirects properly after account deletion

### 2. üéµ **Dual Streaming Platform System**

#### **New Platforms:**

**Tunify** (Spotify-inspired)
- üéµ Green branding (#1DB954)
- $0.003 per stream
- 85% popularity rating
- Description: "Most popular streaming platform globally with massive reach"
- Best for: Maximum exposure and audience reach

**Maple Music** (Apple Music-inspired)  
- üçé Red branding (#FC3C44)
- $0.01 per stream (3.3x higher royalties!)
- 65% popularity rating
- Description: "Premium platform with higher royalties but smaller audience"
- Best for: Higher per-stream earnings with quality-focused audience

#### **Strategic Trade-off:**
- **Tunify**: Lower royalties but bigger audience ‚Üí More total streams
- **Maple Music**: Higher royalties but smaller audience ‚Üí Better pay per stream

### 3. üì± **Updated Release Song Screen**

**New Platform Selector:**
- Appears after song preview, before cover art designer
- Shows both platforms with:
  - Platform emoji and branding colors
  - Royalty rate per stream
  - Popularity percentage
  - Description of strengths
- Visual indicators when platform is selected
- Defaults to Tunify

**Dynamic Revenue Calculations:**
- Expected results now use selected platform's royalty rate
- Maple Music releases show 3.3x higher estimated revenue
- Tunify releases show lower per-stream but potentially more total earnings

### 4. üóÇÔ∏è **New Models Created**

**`lib/models/streaming_platform.dart`:**
```dart
class StreamingPlatform {
  final String id;
  final String name;
  final String color;
  final String emoji;
  final double royaltiesPerStream;
  final int popularity;
  final String description;
}
```

**Updated `lib/models/song.dart`:**
- Added `streamingPlatform` field (String?)
- Stores which platform song was released on
- Used for tracking and analytics

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified:
1. **lib/main.dart** - Added named routes
2. **lib/models/song.dart** - Added streaming platform field
3. **lib/screens/release_song_screen.dart** - Added platform selector UI
4. **lib/models/streaming_platform.dart** - New file

### Key Methods Added:
- `_buildPlatformSelector()` - Main platform selection widget
- `_buildPlatformOption(platform)` - Individual platform card
- `_buildPlatformStat(emoji, text, platform)` - Platform statistics display
- `StreamingPlatform.getById(id)` - Retrieve platform by ID
- `StreamingPlatform.getColorValue()` - Convert hex to Flutter Color int

### Revenue Calculation:
```dart
// Before (fixed rate)
final estimatedRevenue = (estimatedStreams * 0.003).round();

// After (dynamic based on platform)
final platform = StreamingPlatform.getById(_selectedPlatform);
final estimatedRevenue = (estimatedStreams * platform.royaltiesPerStream).round();
```
