## Code Architecture

### New Methods in AdminService

```dart
// Player Management
Future<void> suspendPlayer(String playerId, bool suspend)
Future<void> deletePlayer(String playerId)
Future<void> banPlayer(String playerId, bool banned)

// Game State
Future<void> advanceGameTime(int days)
Future<void> resetPlayerStats(String playerId)
Future<void> adjustPlayerResources(String playerId, {
  int? addMoney,
  int? addFame,
  int? addFanbase,
  bool? restoreEnergy,
})

// Analytics
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getTopPlayersByFame(int limit)
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getTopPlayersByMoney(int limit)
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getTopPlayersByFanbase(int limit)
Future<Map<String, int>> getPlayerCounts()
Future<int> getTotalSongsCount()
Future<Map<String, double>> getAverageStats()

// Messaging
Future<void> sendGlobalAnnouncement(String title, String message)
Future<void> sendMessageToPlayer(String playerId, String title, String message)

// Events
Future<void> createSpecialEvent(Map<String, dynamic> eventData)
Future<List<Map<String, dynamic>>> getActiveEvents()
```

### Admin Dashboard State

```dart
class _AdminDashboardScreenState extends State<AdminDashboardScreen> {
  final AdminService _adminService = AdminService();
  final FirebaseFirestore _firestore = FirebaseFirestore.instance;
  final FirebaseAuth _auth = FirebaseAuth.instance;
  
  int _selectedTab = 0;
  List<Map<String, dynamic>> _players = [];
  bool _isLoading = true;
  
  // Tab views
  Widget _buildPlayersTab()
  Widget _buildAnalyticsTab()
  Widget _buildEventsTab()
  Widget _buildMessagesTab()
}
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Suspend a Player
```dart
await _adminService.suspendPlayer('player123', true);
// Player is now suspended
```

### Advance Game Time by 7 Days
```dart
await _adminService.advanceGameTime(7);
// Global game date advanced 7 days
// All player streams updated
```

### Send Global Announcement
```dart
await _adminService.sendGlobalAnnouncement(
  '🎉 Double Stream Weekend!',
  'All streams count double this weekend. Release your best songs now!'
);
// All players receive notification
```

### Get Top 10 Players
```dart
final topPlayers = await _adminService.getTopPlayersByFame(10);
// Returns list of top 10 players sorted by fame
```

### Create Special Event
```dart
await _adminService.createSpecialEvent({
  'name': '2x Stream Weekend',
  'description': 'All streams doubled',
  'multiplier': 2.0,
  'duration': Duration(days: 2),
  'type': 'stream_boost',
});
// Event is now active for all players
```

## Security Considerations

### Admin Verification
All admin methods check `isAdmin()` before executing:
```dart
Future<bool> isAdmin() async {
  final user = _auth.currentUser;
  if (user == null) return false;
  
  final adminDoc = await _firestore
      .collection('admins')
      .doc(user.uid)
      .get();
      
  return adminDoc.exists;
}
```

### Firestore Rules
```javascript
match /players/{playerId} {
  allow read: if request.auth != null;
  allow write: if request.auth.uid == playerId || isAdmin();
}

function isAdmin() {
  return exists(/databases/$(database)/documents/admins/$(request.auth.uid));
}
```

### Action Logging
All admin actions are logged:
```dart
await _firestore.collection('admin_logs').add({
  'adminId': _auth.currentUser!.uid,
  'action': 'suspend_player',
  'targetId': playerId,
  'timestamp': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
  'details': {'suspended': true},
});
```
