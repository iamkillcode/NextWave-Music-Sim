# 🎵 Monthly Listeners Verification - Executive Summary

**Task**: Verify monthly listeners count for Tunify and Maple Music  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE - Issues Identified and Fixed**

---

## 🔍 What Was Requested

Verify that monthly listeners for Tunify and Maple Music:
1. Are calculated correctly (should equal sum of last 30 days streams)
2. Update automatically during daily cycles
3. Show consistent values across both platforms

---

## ⚠️ Issues Found

### Critical Discrepancies Identified:

1. **Tunify Problem**: 
   - ❌ Used `totalStreams * 0.3` (30% of LIFETIME streams)
   - ❌ Became increasingly inaccurate over time
   - ❌ Didn't reflect actual monthly activity

2. **Maple Music Problem**:
   - ❌ Didn't show monthly listeners AT ALL
   - ❌ Only showed "followers" (40% of fanbase)
   - ❌ Completely different metric than Tunify

3. **Data Model Limitation**:
   - ❌ Song model doesn't track `last30DaysStreams` field
   - ❌ No daily stream history available
   - ❌ Can't calculate true 30-day rolling window

---

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Fix: Use `last7DaysStreams` as 30-Day Proxy

**Formula:**
```dart
monthlyListeners = (last7DaysStreams * 4.3).round()
```

**Rationale:**
- 30 days ≈ 4.3 weeks (30 / 7 = 4.286)
- Uses existing `last7DaysStreams` field (no schema changes)
- Reflects recent activity, not lifetime totals
- Updates automatically with daily decay

---

## 📝 Changes Made

### 1. Tunify Screen (`lib/screens/tunify_screen.dart`)

**Lines 43-52**: Updated calculation
```dart
// OLD: final monthlyListeners = (totalStreams * 0.3).round();
// NEW: final monthlyListeners = (last7DaysStreams * 4.3).round();
```

### 2. Maple Music Screen (`lib/screens/maple_music_screen.dart`)

**Lines 49-61**: Added monthly listeners calculation
```dart
final monthlyListeners = (last7DaysStreams * 4.3).round(); // NEW
final followers = (_currentStats.fanbase * 0.4).round(); // KEPT
```

**Lines 173-201**: Updated UI to show BOTH metrics
- Monthly listeners: Prominent display with headphones icon
- Followers: Secondary display below

### 3. Debug Tool (`lib/debug/verify_monthly_listeners.dart`)

**NEW FILE (220 lines)**: Comprehensive verification tool
- Calculates old vs. new monthly listeners
- Shows discrepancies and percentages
- Provides recommendations
- Formats output for easy analysis

### 4. Documentation

**Created 3 comprehensive documents:**
- `MONTHLY_LISTENERS_VERIFICATION.md` - Detailed analysis (550 lines)
- `MONTHLY_LISTENERS_FIX_COMPLETE.md` - Implementation guide (350 lines)
- `MONTHLY_LISTENERS_BEFORE_AFTER.md` - Visual comparison (180 lines)

## 📊 Impact Example

**Artist with 5,000 fanbase, 50K last 7 days streams, 10M lifetime streams:**

| Platform | Metric | Before | After | Note |
|----------|--------|--------|-------|------|
| Tunify | Monthly Listeners | 3M | 215K | -93% (more accurate!) |
| Maple Music | Monthly Listeners | N/A | 215K | Added metric |
| Maple Music | Followers | 2K | 2K | Unchanged |

**Why the big decrease?**
- OLD: Used 30% of 10M lifetime streams = 3M (inflated)
- NEW: Uses recent 7-day activity * 4.3 = 215K (accurate)
- The artist's old catalog had streams years ago, but current activity is much lower

---

## ✅ Verification Results

### Testing Completed:

1. ✅ **Artist with old catalog**: Monthly listeners decreased (more accurate)
2. ✅ **Artist with new releases**: Monthly listeners increase quickly
3. ✅ **Artist with no releases**: Shows 0 monthly listeners correctly
4. ✅ **Cross-platform consistency**: Both platforms show same value
5. ✅ **Daily update cycle**: Values update with stream decay
6. ✅ **UI display**: Numbers format correctly (K, M, B)
7. ✅ **Compilation**: No errors, only pre-existing warnings

### Debug Tool Output:
```
================================================================================
🎵 MONTHLY LISTENERS VERIFICATION REPORT
================================================================================

📊 Artist: Test Artist
📀 Released Songs: 5
🌍 Total Lifetime Streams: 10.0M
📈 Last 7 Days Streams: 50.0K
📉 Last Day Streams: 8.5K

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🎵 TUNIFY (Spotify-like)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

❌ Current Implementation:
   Monthly Listeners (Current): 3.0M
   Formula: totalStreams * 0.3
   Problem: Uses lifetime streams, not actual monthly activity...

✅ Proposed Fix:
   Monthly Listeners (Proposed): 215.0K
   Formula: last7DaysStreams * 4.3
   Benefit: Uses recent activity (last 7 days) as proxy...

📊 Discrepancy:
   Change: -93.0%
   Absolute Difference: -2.8M

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
🍎 MAPLE MUSIC (Apple Music-like)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

✅ Now shows monthly listeners: 215.0K
✅ Still shows followers: 2.0K
```

## 💡 Key Insights

### Why This Matters:

1. **Player Experience**: Players need accurate feedback on their current success
2. **Game Balance**: Monthly listeners affect perceived progress
3. **Platform Consistency**: Both platforms should use same metrics
4. **Long-term Accuracy**: Formula must work for both new and established artists

### Technical Decisions:

1. **Used approximation**: `last7DaysStreams * 4.3` instead of exact 30-day tracking
   - ✅ No schema changes needed
   - ✅ Works with existing data
   - ✅ Good enough accuracy
   - ⚠️ Assumes consistent weekly patterns

2. **Kept followers metric**: Maple Music now shows BOTH
   - ✅ Monthly listeners (primary) - reflects activity
   - ✅ Followers (secondary) - reflects platform presence

3. **Created debug tool**: Future-proofing for QA
   - ✅ Easy to verify calculations
   - ✅ Can run on any artist profile
   - ✅ Helps catch regressions

## 🔮 Future Enhancements (Optional)

### If exact 30-day tracking is needed later:

**Option A**: Add `last30DaysStreams` field
- Pros: Simple, accurate
- Cons: Requires migration

**Option B**: Track daily history array
- Pros: Perfect accuracy, trend analysis
- Cons: More storage, complex migration

**Decision**: Current solution is sufficient. Only upgrade if precision issues reported.
