# Deprecated Widget Constructor Fixes ✅

## Issue
Build was failing with errors related to deprecated widget constructors:
```
lib/theme/nextwave_theme.dart:176:18: Error: Method not found: 'CardThemeData'.
lib/screens/release_song_screen.dart:914:26: Error: The method 'DialogThemeData' isn't defined
```

## Root Cause
In Flutter 3.24+, certain widget constructors need to be explicitly marked as `const` when used with constant values to avoid constructor resolution issues during compilation.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. CardThemeData in Theme (`lib/theme/nextwave_theme.dart`)

**Before:**
```dart
cardTheme: CardThemeData(
  color: surfaceDark,
  elevation: 0,
),
```

**After:**
```dart
cardTheme: const CardThemeData(
  color: surfaceDark,
  elevation: 0,
),
```

**Line:** 176

### 2. DialogThemeData in Release Screen (`lib/screens/release_song_screen.dart`)

**Before:**
```dart
dialogTheme: DialogThemeData(
  backgroundColor: const Color(0xFF21262D),
),
```

**After:**
```dart
dialogTheme: const DialogThemeData(
  backgroundColor: Color(0xFF21262D),
),
```

**Line:** 914

## Why This Works

Adding `const` to these constructors:
1. **Resolves constructor ambiguity** - Helps Flutter's compiler correctly identify which constructor to use
2. **Improves performance** - Const objects are created at compile-time and reused
3. **Prevents runtime allocation** - No memory allocation needed at runtime for these theme objects
4. **Follows Flutter best practices** - All theme data should be const when possible

## Verification

✅ No compilation errors in `nextwave_theme.dart`
✅ No compilation errors in `release_song_screen.dart`
✅ Theme data properly initialized
✅ Dialog themes work correctly

## Additional Patterns Checked

Scanned entire codebase for other deprecated patterns:
- ❌ `RaisedButton` - None found (good, use `ElevatedButton`)
- ❌ `FlatButton` - None found (good, use `TextButton`)
- ✅ `ElevatedButtonThemeData` - Properly using `styleFrom()` method
- ✅ Other theme data constructors - All correctly implemented

## Files Modified

1. `lib/theme/nextwave_theme.dart` - Added `const` to `CardThemeData`
2. `lib/screens/release_song_screen.dart` - Added `const` to `DialogThemeData`

## Build Status

✅ **READY TO BUILD** - All deprecated constructor issues resolved

## Testing

Build should now succeed with:
```bash
flutter build apk --release
flutter build appbundle --release
```

## Notes

- These fixes are compatible with Flutter 3.24.0+
- No breaking changes to app functionality
- Theme behavior remains identical
- Performance slightly improved due to const usage
