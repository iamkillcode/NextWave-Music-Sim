# Java Version Fix - GitHub Actions Compatibility

## Error
```
FAILURE: Build failed with an exception.
* What went wrong:
Execution failed for task ':app:compileDebugJavaWithJavac'.
> error: invalid source release: 21
```

## Root Cause
- **build.gradle.kts** was configured for Java 21
- **GitHub Actions workflow** uses Java 17
- Mismatch caused compilation failure

## Solution
Updated `android/app/build.gradle.kts` to use Java 17:

```kotlin
// Before
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_21
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_21
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "21"
    freeCompilerArgs += listOf("-Xjvm-default=all")
}

// After
compileOptions {
    sourceCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    targetCompatibility = JavaVersion.VERSION_17
    isCoreLibraryDesugaringEnabled = true
}

kotlinOptions {
    jvmTarget = "17"
    freeCompilerArgs += listOf("-Xjvm-default=all")
}
```

## Why Java 17?
1. ✅ **GitHub Actions standard**: Java 17 is the default LTS version
2. ✅ **Flutter compatibility**: Flutter 3.24.0 fully supports Java 17
3. ✅ **Android support**: All Android SDK features work with Java 17
4. ✅ **Stability**: LTS release, widely adopted
5. ✅ **CI/CD friendly**: Available on all runners without extra setup

## Java 17 vs Java 21
Both are Long-Term Support (LTS) versions, but:
- **Java 17**: More widely supported in CI/CD environments
- **Java 21**: Newer, but requires explicit setup in workflows
- For this project: Java 17 is sufficient and more reliable

## Files Modified
- `android/app/build.gradle.kts` - Changed Java 21 → Java 17

## Local Development
If you're using Java 21 locally, the project will still work. Java is backward compatible.

To check your local Java version:
```bash
java -version
```

## Result
- ✅ Builds will succeed on GitHub Actions
- ✅ Compatible with CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ No need to modify workflow file
- ✅ Consistent across environments
