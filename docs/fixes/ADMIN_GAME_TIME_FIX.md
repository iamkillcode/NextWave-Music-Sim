# Admin Game Time Adjustment Fix

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fixed

---

## Problem

The "Adjust Game Time" feature in the admin dashboard was not working:
- ‚ùå Showed error: "Game time not initialized"
- ‚ùå Could not load current game date
- ‚ùå Could not adjust time forward/backward

---

## Root Cause

**Collection/Document Mismatch:**

The admin dashboard was looking for the wrong Firestore path:

```dart
// ‚ùå WRONG - Admin dashboard was using:
_firestore.collection('game_state').doc('global_time')
  .get()['currentGameDate']

// ‚úÖ CORRECT - Actual game time system uses:
_firestore.collection('gameSettings').doc('globalTime')
  .get()['realWorldStartDate'] + calculations
```

**Field Structure Mismatch:**

The game time system doesn't store a single `currentGameDate` field. Instead, it calculates the current game date dynamically based on:
- `realWorldStartDate` - When the game started in real time
- `gameWorldStartDate` - The starting date in-game (2020-01-01)
- Time elapsed calculation: 1 real hour = 1 game day

---

## Solution

### 1. Fixed Collection/Document Path

**Before:**
```dart
final gameTimeDoc = await _firestore
    .collection('game_state')
    .doc('global_time')
    .get();
```

**After:**
```dart
final gameSettingsDoc = await _firestore
    .collection('gameSettings')
    .doc('globalTime')
    .get();
```

### 2. Fixed Date Calculation

**Before:**
```dart
// Tried to read a single field that doesn't exist
final currentDate = (gameTimeDoc.data()!['currentGameDate'] as Timestamp).toDate();
```

**After:**
```dart
// Calculate game date based on elapsed time
final data = gameSettingsDoc.data()!;
final realWorldStartDate = (data['realWorldStartDate'] as Timestamp).toDate();
final gameWorldStartDate = (data['gameWorldStartDate'] as Timestamp).toDate();

final now = DateTime.now();
final realHoursElapsed = now.difference(realWorldStartDate).inHours;
final gameDaysElapsed = realHoursElapsed; // 1 hour = 1 day

final calculatedDate = gameWorldStartDate.add(Duration(days: gameDaysElapsed));
final currentDate = DateTime(
  calculatedDate.year,
  calculatedDate.month,
  calculatedDate.day,
);
```

### 3. Fixed Time Adjustment Logic

**Before:**
```dart
// Tried to update a field that doesn't exist
await _firestore
    .collection('game_state')
    .doc('global_time')
    .update({
  'currentGameDate': Timestamp.fromDate(newDate),
});
```

**After:**
```dart
// Adjust the realWorldStartDate to simulate time travel
// Moving BACKWARD in real time = moving FORWARD in game time
final adjustedRealWorldStart = realWorldStartDate.subtract(
  Duration(hours: daysToAdjust), // 1 hour per game day
);

await _firestore
    .collection('gameSettings')
    .doc('globalTime')
    .update({
  'realWorldStartDate': Timestamp.fromDate(adjustedRealWorldStart),
  'lastUpdated': FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
});
```

---

## How Time Adjustment Works

### Time Travel Logic

The game time system is relative - it calculates the current date based on:
```
Current Game Date = gameWorldStartDate + (hours elapsed since realWorldStartDate)
```

To "move forward" in game time, we actually move the `realWorldStartDate` **backward**:

**Example: Move 7 days forward**
```
realWorldStartDate = Oct 1, 2025, 10:00 AM
Current real time   = Oct 19, 2025, 2:00 PM
Hours elapsed       = 436 hours
Current game date   = Jan 1, 2020 + 436 days = Feb 10, 2021

To move 7 days forward:
New realWorldStartDate = Oct 1, 2025, 10:00 AM - 7 hours = Oct 1, 3:00 AM
Hours elapsed          = 443 hours (7 more)
New game date          = Jan 1, 2020 + 443 days = Feb 17, 2021 ‚úÖ
```

**Example: Move 30 days backward**
```
To move 30 days backward:
New realWorldStartDate = Oct 1, 2025, 10:00 AM + 30 hours = Oct 2, 4:00 PM
Hours elapsed          = 406 hours (30 fewer)
New game date          = Jan 1, 2020 + 406 days = Jan 11, 2021 ‚úÖ
```

## Game Time System Architecture

### Firestore Structure

**Path:** `gameSettings/globalTime`

```javascript
{
  realWorldStartDate: Timestamp,     // When game started in real world
  gameWorldStartDate: Timestamp,     // Starting date in-game (2020-01-01)
  hoursPerDay: 1,                    // 1 real hour = 1 game day
  description: "1 real world hour equals 1 in-game day",
  lastUpdated: Timestamp             // Last modification
}
```

### Time Ratio

```
1 real hour = 1 in-game day
24 real hours = 24 in-game days
1 real week = 168 in-game days (~5.5 months)
```

## Testing

### Test Case 1: Load Current Game Date
1. ‚úÖ Open admin dashboard
2. ‚úÖ Click "Adjust Game Time"
3. ‚úÖ Should show current game date (e.g., "Feb 10, 2021")
4. ‚úÖ No error message

### Test Case 2: Move Forward
1. ‚úÖ Click + button to add days
2. ‚úÖ Shows preview: "New Date: Feb 17, 2021"
3. ‚úÖ Click "Apply"
4. ‚úÖ Success message appears
5. ‚úÖ All players see new date immediately

### Test Case 3: Move Backward
1. ‚úÖ Click - button to subtract days
2. ‚úÖ Shows preview: "New Date: Jan 11, 2021"
3. ‚úÖ Click "Apply"
4. ‚úÖ Success message appears
5. ‚úÖ Time rolls back for all players

### Test Case 4: Fast Forward/Rewind
1. ‚úÖ Click fast_forward icon (+7 days)
2. ‚úÖ Click fast_rewind icon (-7 days)
3. ‚úÖ Buttons work correctly

## Use Cases

### 1. Testing Scheduled Events
```
Scenario: Album release scheduled for Feb 20, 2021
Current: Feb 10, 2021
Action: Fast forward +10 days
Result: Album releases immediately
```

### 2. Testing Contract Expiry
```
Scenario: Side hustle expires March 1, 2021
Current: Feb 25, 2021
Action: Fast forward +7 days
Result: Contract terminates
```

### 3. Testing Daily Updates
```
Scenario: Test stream decay over 30 days
Action: Move forward +30 days
Result: See 30 days of stream decay
```

### 4. Rolling Back Mistakes
```
Scenario: Accidentally moved too far forward
Action: Move backward to correct date
Result: Time restored
```

## Related Systems

### Game Time Service
**File:** `lib/services/game_time_service.dart`
- Defines the time calculation algorithm
- Used by all game systems
- Admin dashboard now matches this logic

### Cloud Functions
**File:** `functions/index.js`
- `dailyGameUpdate` function runs every hour
- Processes streams, royalties, contract expiry
- Now properly syncs with adjusted game time

---

## Best Practices

### When to Use Time Adjustment

‚úÖ **Good uses:**
- Testing time-dependent features
- Simulating future scenarios
- Demonstrating gameplay progression
- QA testing

‚ùå **Avoid:**
- Production environments with real players
- Going backward after major events
- Extreme jumps (years forward/backward)
- During active gameplay sessions

### Admin Notes

```
‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: Time adjustment affects ALL players immediately!

- All scheduled events will trigger based on new date
- Contracts may expire instantly if moved forward
- Song releases will drop if date reached
- Player stats recalculate

Always test in a separate environment first!
```
