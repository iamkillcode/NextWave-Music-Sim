# Charts & Daily Notifications Fix

**Date:** October 18, 2025  
**Priority:** High  
**Status:** ✅ Fixed & Deployed

---

## Problems Reported

### 1. Charts Showing 0 Streams
**Issue:** Players complained that despite releasing songs recently, charts showed 0 streams or songs weren't appearing.

### 2. No Daily Royalty Notifications  
**Issue:** Players weren't receiving notifications when they earned daily royalties from streams.

---

## Root Causes

### Chart Problem
The chart service (`spotlight_chart_service.dart`) was reading the wrong field:
- **Charts read:** `songMap['totalStreams']`
- **Songs actually use:** `songMap['streams']`

This mismatch caused:
- Songs to show 0 streams on charts
- Charts to be empty even with active songs
- Player confusion about their performance

### Notification Problem
The Cloud Function (`processDailyStreamsForPlayer`) was:
- ✅ Calculating streams correctly
- ✅ Paying royalties automatically
- ❌ **NOT creating notifications**

Players had no visibility into their passive income.

---

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Chart Field Mismatch

**File:** `lib/services/spotlight_chart_service.dart`

#### Spotlight Hot 100 (Line ~104)
```dart
// BEFORE
final totalStreams = songMap['totalStreams'] ?? 0;

// AFTER
final totalStreams = songMap['streams'] ?? songMap['totalStreams'] ?? 0;
```

#### Spotlight 200 (Line ~36)
```dart
// BEFORE
final totalStreams = songMap['totalStreams'] ?? 0;

// AFTER
final totalStreams = songMap['streams'] ?? songMap['totalStreams'] ?? 0;
```

**Why This Works:**
- First tries `streams` (current field used by Cloud Functions)
- Falls back to `totalStreams` (legacy field for compatibility)
- Ensures all songs display correctly regardless of when they were created

---

### 2. Added Daily Royalty Notifications

**File:** `functions/index.js` (Line ~419)

Added notification creation when royalties are paid:

```javascript
// ✅ CREATE NOTIFICATION for daily royalties (only if earning money)
if (totalNewIncome > 0) {
  try {
    await db.collection('notifications').add({
      userId: playerId,
      type: 'royalty_payment',
      title: '💰 Daily Royalties',
      message: `You earned $${totalNewIncome.toLocaleString()} from ${totalNewStreams.toLocaleString()} streams!`,
      amount: totalNewIncome,
      streams: totalNewStreams,
      read: false,
      timestamp: admin.firestore.FieldValue.serverTimestamp(),
    });
    console.log(`📬 Created royalty notification for ${playerData.displayName || playerId}: $${totalNewIncome}`);
  } catch (notifError) {
    console.error(`Failed to create notification for ${playerId}:`, notifError);
  }
}
```

**Notification Fields:**
- `userId` - Player who earned the money
- `type` - `'royalty_payment'` for filtering
- `title` - "💰 Daily Royalties"
- `message` - Formatted with earnings and streams
- `amount` - Dollar amount earned
- `streams` - Total streams received
- `read` - False by default
- `timestamp` - Server timestamp for ordering

---

## How It Works Now

### Daily Game Update (Every Hour = 1 In-Game Day)

1. **Cloud Function Runs** (`dailyGameUpdate`)
   - Processes ALL players (online + offline)
   - Updates global game date

2. **For Each Player:**
   ```javascript
   FOR each song:
     - Calculate new streams based on fanbase, quality, virality
     - Apply age decay (new songs get more, old songs decline)
     - Update last7DaysStreams with 14.3% daily decay
     - Distribute streams across regions
     - Calculate royalty income (Tunify $0.003, Maple $0.01)
   
   IF totalNewIncome > 0:
     - Add money to player account
     - CREATE NOTIFICATION 💰
     - Log payment
   
   UPDATE player document with:
     - New song streams
     - Updated money
     - Regional fanbase growth
     - Notification created
   ```

3. **Charts Update:**
   - Hot 100: Ranks by `last7DaysStreams` (resets weekly)
   - Spotlight 200: Ranks by `streams` (all-time)
   - Both now read correct field ✅

4. **Notifications Display:**
   - Show in notification icon/bell
   - Unread count badge
   - Click to mark as read
   - Show earnings history

## Verification

### Test 1: Charts Display Streams ✅
```
BEFORE: Charts showed 0 streams for all songs
AFTER:  Charts display actual stream counts correctly
```

### Test 2: Daily Notifications Created ✅
```
BEFORE: No notifications when royalties paid
AFTER:  Notification created every game day with earnings
```

### Test 3: Notification Content ✅
```
Example Notification:
Title: 💰 Daily Royalties
Message: You earned $847 from 28,234 streams!
```

---

## Stream & Royalty Flow

### Streaming Platforms
| Platform | Pay Rate | Market Share |
|----------|----------|--------------|
| Tunify | $0.003/stream | 85% |
| Maple Music | $0.01/stream | 65% |

*Note: Total can exceed 100% (multi-platform)*

### Daily Calculation
```
1. Base Streams = f(fanbase, quality, virality, age)
2. Regional Distribution = based on fanbase location
3. Platform Split = Tunify (85%) + Maple (65%)
4. Income = (Tunify streams × $0.003) + (Maple streams × $0.01)
5. Add money to player
6. Create notification ✅ NEW
7. Update last7DaysStreams for charts
```

### Chart Ranking
```
Hot 100 (Singles):
- Ranks by last7DaysStreams
- Decays 14.3% per day
- Creates "reset" effect
- Only released singles

Spotlight 200 (Albums):
- Ranks by total streams
- All-time cumulative
- Only released albums
```

## Player Experience

### Before Fixes
```
Morning:
❌ Check charts → See 0 streams (confused)
❌ Check money → Went up, but no notification
❌ Wonder if game is working

Result: Confusion, support tickets, frustration
```

### After Fixes
```
Morning:
✅ Notification: "💰 Daily Royalties - You earned $847 from 28,234 streams!"
✅ Check charts → Song #47 on Hot 100 (accurate)
✅ Clear feedback on performance

Result: Engaged, informed, motivated
```

## Impact

### Charts
- **Before:** Empty or showing 0 streams
- **After:** Accurate real-time rankings

### Player Engagement
- **Before:** Passive income invisible
- **After:** Daily notification with exact earnings

### Support Burden
- **Before:** "Why are my songs at 0 streams?"
- **After:** Clear feedback, fewer questions

## Technical Details

### Notification Collection
```
/notifications/{notificationId}
  - userId: string
  - type: 'royalty_payment' | 'achievement' | 'gift' | ...
  - title: string
  - message: string
  - amount: number (optional)
  - streams: number (optional)
  - read: boolean

  .limit(50)
```

## Testing

### Manual Test
1. Release a song
2. Wait for next hour (1 game day)
3. Check notifications → Should see royalty payment
4. Check charts → Song should appear with streams
5. Play for several days → Notifications accumulate

### Automated Test (Future)
```javascript
test('Daily royalty creates notification', async () => {
  const player = createTestPlayer();
  const song = createReleasedSong();
  
  await processDailyStreamsForPlayer(player.id, player, new Date());
  
  const notifications = await getPlayerNotifications(player.id);
  expect(notifications).toHaveLength(1);
  expect(notifications[0].type).toBe('royalty_payment');
  expect(notifications[0].amount).toBeGreaterThan(0);
});
```

## Summary

✅ **Charts Fixed** - Now read correct `streams` field  
✅ **Notifications Added** - Daily royalty alerts created  
✅ **Player Visibility** - Clear feedback on earnings  
✅ **Deployed** - Live in production  

**Impact:** Players now have full visibility into their passive income and chart performance. No more confusion about "0 streams" or invisible earnings.
