# Hype (Creativity) Persistence Bug - Fixed

## Date
October 20, 2025

## Issue Summary
**Critical Bug**: The Hype stat (displayed as "Hype" in UI, stored as `creativity` in database) was NOT being saved to Firestore, causing all Hype gains to be lost on app refresh/reload.

## Problem Details

### What Was Happening
1. **User gains Hype** from activities:
   - Post on social media ‚Üí +2 Hype
   - Post on EchoX ‚Üí +2 Hype  
   - Write songs ‚Üí +creativity based on song type
   
2. **UI showed increases** - Local state updated correctly

3. **Data was NOT saved** - On refresh/reload, all Hype gains were lost

### Root Cause
The `firebase_service.dart` `updatePlayerStats()` function was missing the `creativity` field in the payload sent to the Cloud Function:

**Before:**
```dart
'updates': {
  'currentMoney': stats.money,
  'currentFame': stats.fame,
  'fanbase': stats.fanbase,
  'energy': stats.energy,
  // ‚ùå MISSING: creativity field
  'songwritingSkill': stats.songwritingSkill,
  // ... other stats
}
```

**Result**: The `creativity` stat was NEVER sent to Firestore, so changes were lost.

## Impact
- **Severity**: High (affects core engagement loop)
- **Affected Users**: All players who posted on social media, EchoX, or wrote songs
- **User Experience**: Frustrating - felt like progress was being lost
- **Gameplay**: Reduced motivation to use social features

## Solution

### Fix 1: Client-Side (firebase_service.dart)
Added the missing `creativity` field to the update payload:

```dart
'updates': {
  'currentMoney': stats.money,
  'currentFame': stats.fame,
  'fanbase': stats.fanbase,
  'energy': stats.energy,
  'creativity': stats.creativity, // üé® FIX: Save Hype stat!
  'songwritingSkill': stats.songwritingSkill,
  // ... other stats
}
```

### Fix 2: Server-Side (functions/index.js)
Added explicit validation for `creativity` and `experience` in `secureStatUpdate`:

```javascript
case 'experience':
  // XP can grow rapidly from writing songs, performing, etc.
  if (!validateStatChange(oldValue, newValue, stat, 200)) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('invalid-argument', `Invalid experience change`);
  }
  validatedUpdates[stat] = Math.max(0, newValue); // No upper limit
  break;

case 'creativity':
case 'inspirationLevel':
  // üé® Creativity (Hype) and Inspiration - can grow significantly from activities
  if (!validateStatChange(oldValue, newValue, stat, 100)) {
    throw new functions.https.HttpsError('invalid-argument', `Invalid ${stat} change`);
  }
  validatedUpdates[stat] = Math.max(0, newValue); // No upper limit
  break;
```

### Validation Logic
- **Max Change**: 100 points per update (prevents cheating)
- **No Upper Limit**: Creativity can grow indefinitely
- **Non-Negative**: Minimum value of 0

## Files Modified

1. **lib/services/firebase_service.dart** (Line ~120)
   - Added `'creativity': stats.creativity,` to update payload

2. **functions/index.js** (Lines ~1586-1603)
   - Added explicit `case 'experience':` validation
   - Added explicit `case 'creativity':` and `case 'inspirationLevel':` validation
   - Prevents anti-cheat system from flagging legitimate Hype/XP gains

## Testing

### Test Scenario 1: Social Media Post
1. Note current Hype value
2. Post on social media (costs 10 energy)
3. Verify Hype increased by +2
4. Refresh the app
5. ‚úÖ Verify Hype is still increased (not reverted)

### Test Scenario 2: EchoX Post
1. Note current Hype value
2. Post on EchoX (costs 5 energy)
3. Verify Hype increased by +2
4. Reload the page
5. ‚úÖ Verify Hype persisted

### Test Scenario 3: Song Writing
1. Note current Hype value
2. Write a song (any genre/effort)
3. Verify Hype increased (amount varies by song type)
4. Close and reopen app
5. ‚úÖ Verify Hype gain persisted

## Deployment
```bash
# Deploy the Cloud Function update
firebase deploy --only functions:secureStatUpdate
# Status: ‚úÖ Deployed successfully on October 20, 2025
```

## Prevention
To prevent similar issues in the future:

1. **Checklist for New Stats**: When adding new stats, verify:
   - [ ] Stat is in `ArtistStats` model
   - [ ] Stat is included in `updatePlayerStats()` payload
   - [ ] Stat has validation in `secureStatUpdate` Cloud Function
   - [ ] Stat is displayed in UI if needed

2. **Integration Testing**: Add tests that:
   - Update a stat locally
   - Call `updatePlayerStats()`
   - Reload data from Firestore
   - Verify stat persisted

3. **Code Review**: Always check that new stats are included in save operations

## Related Issues
- Song persistence bug (October 20, 2025) - songs array was missing from payload
- Admin stat update issue (October 20, 2025) - action validation needed updates

## Verification
‚úÖ **Client Fix Deployed**: `creativity` now included in update payload  
‚úÖ **Server Fix Deployed**: Explicit validation added for creativity/experience  
‚è≥ **Pending User Testing**: Awaiting confirmation from users that Hype persists correctly

## Notes
- This bug existed since the social media and EchoX features were added
- No data loss for past activities (they were never saved)
- Users will start seeing Hype gains persist immediately after fix deployment
- Consider adding a one-time Hype bonus to compensate affected users
