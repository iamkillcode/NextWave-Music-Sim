# Regional Charts & Spotlight System Fixes - Complete

## Issues Fixed ✅

### 1. **TypeError: Null is not a subtype of Song** ✅
**Problem:** Regional charts screen was expecting a `Song` object but the service was returning flat `Map<String, dynamic>` data.

**Solution:**
- Modified `regional_charts_screen.dart` line 250 to extract song data directly from the map instead of casting to Song object
- Changed from: `final song = songData['song'] as Song;`
- Changed to: Direct extraction of title, artist, genre, and streams from flat map structure
- Updated all references to use extracted variables instead of Song object properties

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/screens/regional_charts_screen.dart` (lines 250-380)

---

### 2. **Released Songs Not Showing in Charts** ✅
**Problem:** Songs in "writing", "recording", or other non-released states were appearing in charts.

**Solution:**
- Added state filter in `RegionalChartService.getTopSongsByRegion()` to only include songs with `state == 'released'`
- Added same filter in `RegionalChartService.getGlobalChart()` for consistency
- Charts now only display properly released songs

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/services/regional_chart_service.dart` (lines 85-105, lines 295-315)

---

### 3. **Spotlight 200 Chart System Created** ✅
**Feature:** New chart system for albums only.

**Implementation:**
- Created `SpotlightChartService` with dedicated methods for Spotlight charts
- `getSpotlight200()`: Returns top 200 albums sorted by total streams
- Only includes songs where `isAlbum == true` and `state == 'released'`
- Added `isAlbum` field to Song model to distinguish albums from singles

**Files Created:**
- `lib/services/spotlight_chart_service.dart`
- `lib/screens/spotlight_charts_screen.dart`

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/models/song.dart` - Added `isAlbum` field with full serialization support

---

### 4. **Spotlight Hot 100 Chart System Created** ✅
**Feature:** New chart for singles that resets every 7 in-game days.

**Implementation:**
- `getSpotlightHot100()`: Returns top 100 singles from the last 7 game days
- Uses `GameTimeService.getCurrentGameDate()` to calculate 7-day cutoff
- Only includes songs where:
  - `isAlbum == false` (singles only)
  - `state == 'released'`
  - `releaseDate` is within last 7 game days
- Automatically filters out older singles, creating the "rolling reset" effect

**Files Created:**
- `lib/services/spotlight_chart_service.dart` (Hot 100 method)
- `lib/screens/spotlight_charts_screen.dart` (Hot 100 tab with info banner)

---

### 5. **Regional Charts Alignment with Spotlight** ✅
**Feature:** Unified chart display system.

**Implementation:**
- Both Regional and Spotlight charts now use consistent UI design:
  - Gold/Silver/Bronze medals for top 3
  - Genre color coding
  - Stream count formatting (1K, 1M notation)
  - User's songs highlighted with colored borders
  - Trending indicators for top performers
- Same data structure returned by both services

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
```
Firebase Players Collection
    ↓
SpotlightChartService / RegionalChartService
    ↓ (Query + Filter)
List<Map<String, dynamic>>
    ↓
Charts Screen (FutureBuilder)
    ↓
UI Display
```

### Chart Filtering Logic

**Regional Charts:**
```dart
- state == 'released'
- regionalStreams[region] > 0
- Sort by regionalStreams (descending)
```

**Spotlight 200:**
```dart
- state == 'released'
- isAlbum == true
- totalStreams > 0
- Sort by totalStreams (descending)
```

**Spotlight Hot 100:**
```dart
- state == 'released'
- isAlbum == false (singles)
- totalStreams > 0
- releaseDate > (currentGameDate - 7 days)
- Sort by totalStreams (descending)
```

---

## Integration with Existing Systems

### Game Time Service
- Hot 100 chart uses `getCurrentGameDate()` to calculate 7-day cutoff
- Ensures chart resets align with in-game time progression
- Date comparisons use game time, not real-world time

### Firebase Structure
- Charts query `players` collection
- Extract `songs` array from each player document
- No changes required to existing Firebase schema
- New `isAlbum` field will default to `false` for existing songs

### Regional System Integration
- Spotlight charts complement regional charts
- Same genre color system
- Same formatting utilities
- Consistent user experience

---

## Next Steps for Integration

### 1. Add Navigation to Spotlight Charts
Add button/menu item in your main navigation to open Spotlight Charts screen:

```dart
Navigator.push(
  context,
  MaterialPageRoute(builder: (context) => const SpotlightChartsScreen()),
);
```

### 2. Update Song Creation
When creating new songs, set the `isAlbum` field:

```dart
Song(
  // ... other fields
  isAlbum: false, // or true for albums
);
```

### 3. Consider Adding Release Type Selection
In your song creation/recording UI, add a toggle:
```dart
bool _isAlbum = false;

SwitchListTile(
  title: Text('Release as Album'),
  value: _isAlbum,
  onChanged: (value) => setState(() => _isAlbum = value),
);
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Regional Charts:**
   - Verify only released songs appear
   - Check TypeError is resolved
   - Confirm proper sorting by regional streams

2. **Test Spotlight 200:**
   - Create/release an album (set `isAlbum: true`)
   - Verify it appears on Spotlight 200
   - Confirm singles don't appear on this chart

3. **Test Hot 100:**
   - Release a single (set `isAlbum: false`)
   - Verify it appears on Hot 100
   - Wait 7 game days and confirm it disappears

4. **Test Edge Cases:**
   - No songs released yet (empty state)
   - Song released exactly 7 days ago
   - Multiple songs by same artist
