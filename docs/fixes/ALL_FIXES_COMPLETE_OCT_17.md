## Database Changes

### New Fields
1. **players collection:**
   - `lastActivityDate` (DateTime, nullable) - For fame decay tracking

2. **echox_posts collection:**
   - `comments` (int, default: 0) - Comment count for UI

3. **echox_posts/{postId}/comments subcollection:**
   - NEW subcollection for storing comments
   - Fields: authorId, authorName, content, timestamp, likes, likedBy

### New Cloud Functions
1. `forceNPCRelease` - Admin function to generate NPC songs

---

## Performance Impact

### Minimal Impact
- **Fame Decay:** Runs during daily update (already scheduled), O(1) per player
- **ViralWave Validation:** Client-side only, O(n) where n = songs (typically <100)
- **Comments:** Standard Firestore queries with proper indexing

### Database Reads/Writes
- **Fame Decay:** No extra reads, writes only when decay applies
- **Comments:** 1 read for thread, 1 write per comment, 1 write for counter
- **NPC Release:** 1-2 writes (NPC document + EchoX post)

---

## Code Quality

- ‚úÖ All Dart code follows Flutter best practices
- ‚úÖ JavaScript uses proper async/await patterns
- ‚úÖ Type safety maintained throughout
