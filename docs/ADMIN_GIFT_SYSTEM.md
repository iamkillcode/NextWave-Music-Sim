  "read": false,
  "fromAdmin": true,
  "adminId": "admin_uid_123"
}
```

## üìä Admin Audit Trail

All gifts are logged in the `admin_gifts` collection for:
- **Accountability**: Track who sent what to whom
- **Analytics**: See gift distribution patterns
- **Support**: Reference for player support requests
- **Debugging**: Verify gift delivery

Query example:
```javascript
// Get all gifts sent to a player
db.collection('admin_gifts')
  .where('recipientId', '==', userId)
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .get();

// Get all gifts sent by an admin
db.collection('admin_gifts')
  .where('adminId', '==', adminId)
  .orderBy('timestamp', 'desc')
  .get();
```
