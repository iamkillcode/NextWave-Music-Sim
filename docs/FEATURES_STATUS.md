## Feature #6: Player Age System

### Status: ✅ FULLY IMPLEMENTED

### What's Working:

#### 🎂 **Age Selection During Onboarding**
Located in: `lib/screens/onboarding_screen.dart`

**Features:**
- ✅ New onboarding page (Page 3 of 5)
- ✅ Age slider: 16-50 years range
- ✅ Large display showing selected age (72pt font)
- ✅ Cake icon (🎂) for visual clarity
- ✅ Info message: "Your age will progress as you play"
- ✅ Smooth slider interaction

#### 📅 **Age Progression System**
Located in: `lib/models/artist_stats.dart`

**Features:**
- ✅ Stores starting age (16-50)
- ✅ Records career start date as `DateTime`
- ✅ Calculates current age based on in-game time
- ✅ Formula: `current age = starting age + years passed`

**Method:**
```dart
int getCurrentAge(DateTime currentGameDate) {
  if (careerStartDate == null) return age;
  final yearsPassed = currentGameDate.difference(careerStartDate!).inDays ~/ 365;
  return age + yearsPassed;
}
```

#### 🎮 **Dashboard Display**
Located in: `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`

**Features:**
- ✅ Shows dynamic age in player profile
- ✅ Format: "22 years old • Rising Star"
- ✅ Age updates as game time progresses
- ✅ Integrated with career level display

### Data Model:
**ArtistStats Model** (`lib/models/artist_stats.dart`):
```dart
final int age;                    // Starting age (16-50)
final DateTime? careerStartDate;  // When career began
```

### Database Storage:
**Firestore Structure:**
```
players/{userId} {
  age: 18,
  careerStartDate: Timestamp(2025-10-12T00:00:00Z),
  // ... other fields
}
```

### User Flow:
1. Player starts onboarding
2. Page 1: Welcome screen
3. Page 2: Enter artist name + bio
4. **Page 3: Select age** (NEW - Slider 16-50)
5. Page 4: Choose genre
6. Page 5: Select starting region
7. Age and careerStartDate saved to Firestore
8. Dashboard loads and displays: "{age} years old • {career level}"
9. As game time advances, age increases automatically

### Age Mechanics:
- **Real-time calculation:** Age is calculated dynamically based on current game date
- **Persistent storage:** Both age and careerStartDate saved to Firestore
- **Automatic updates:** Dashboard shows current age without manual updates
- **Future potential:** 
  - Age affects energy recovery (younger = faster)
  - Age affects skill learning speed
  - Retirement mechanics at 45-50 years
  - Age-gated content or achievements
