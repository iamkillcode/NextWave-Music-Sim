# Authentication & UX Improvements

## Overview
This document details the bug fixes and feature enhancements made to improve player experience with authentication and profile management.

---

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Artist Name Change Bug
**Problem:** Players reported they couldn't change their artist names in settings.

**Root Cause:** The Firestore query in `settings_screen.dart` was using the wrong field name:
- Used: `'displayName'` 
- Correct: `'artistName'`

**Solution:**
```dart
// BEFORE (❌ Wrong field name)
final existingUsers = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('players')
    .where('displayName', isEqualTo: newName)
    .get();

// AFTER (✅ Correct field name)
final existingUsers = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('players')
    .where('artistName', isEqualTo: newName)
    .get();
```

**Additional Improvements:**
- Added proper `mounted` checks before showing SnackBars
- Fixed callback flow to properly update parent widget state
- Prevents crashes when widget is disposed during async operations

**File Changed:** `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`

---

### 2. ✅ Enhanced Signup Error Messages
**Problem:** Players received vague error messages during signup that didn't explain what went wrong.

**Old Behavior:**
- Generic message: "An error occurred"
- No guidance on how to fix the issue
- Poor user experience

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive error handling with specific, actionable messages:

```dart
switch (e.code) {
  case 'weak-password':
    message = '❌ Password is too weak. Use at least 6 characters with a mix of letters and numbers.';
    break;
  case 'email-already-in-use':
    message = '❌ An account already exists with this email. Try logging in instead.';
    break;
  case 'invalid-email':
    message = '❌ Invalid email format. Please enter a valid email address.';
    break;
  case 'operation-not-allowed':
    message = '❌ Email/password accounts are not enabled. Please contact support.';
    break;
  case 'network-request-failed':
    message = '❌ Network error. Check your internet connection and try again.';
    break;
  default:
    message = '❌ Sign up failed: ${e.message ?? "Unknown error"}';
}
```

**Features:**
- 6 specific error cases covered
- Visual indicators (❌) for clarity
- Actionable guidance ("Try logging in instead", "Check your internet connection")
- Extended duration (4 seconds) for readability
- Helpful suggestions for each error type

**File Changed:** `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart`

---

### 3. ✅ Enhanced Login Error Messages
**Problem:** Login errors were equally vague, not helping players understand authentication failures.

**Solution:** Implemented comprehensive error handling for login similar to signup:

```dart
switch (e.code) {
  case 'user-not-found':
    message = '❌ No account found. Please check your email/artist name or sign up.';
    break;
  case 'wrong-password':
    message = '❌ Incorrect password. Try again or reset your password.';
    break;
  case 'invalid-email':
    message = '❌ Invalid email format. Please enter a valid email address.';
    break;
  case 'user-disabled':
    message = '❌ This account has been disabled. Contact support for help.';
    break;
  case 'too-many-requests':
    message = '❌ Too many failed attempts. Please wait a few minutes and try again.';
    break;
  case 'network-request-failed':
    message = '❌ Network error. Check your internet connection and try again.';
    break;
  case 'invalid-credential':
    message = '❌ Invalid email or password. Please check your credentials.';
    break;
  default:
    message = '❌ Login failed: ${e.message ?? "Unknown error"}';
}
```

**Features:**
- 8 specific error cases covered
- Security-conscious messages (doesn't reveal if email exists)
- Rate limiting guidance
- Password reset hints
- Network troubleshooting

**File Changed:** `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart`

### 4. ✅ Login with Email OR Artist Name
**Problem:** Players could only login with email, but wanted the flexibility to use their memorable artist name.

**Solution:** Implemented dual login method supporting both email addresses and artist names:

**How It Works:**
1. Player enters email OR artist name in the login field
2. System detects input type:
   - Contains `@` → Email address
   - No `@` → Artist name
3. If artist name:
   - Query Firestore: `collection('players').where('artistName', isEqualTo: name)`
   - Extract associated email from player document
4. Authenticate with Firebase using email (whether directly provided or looked up)

**Code Implementation:**
```dart
Future<void> _handleLogin() async {
  final identifier = _loginIdentifierController.text.trim();
  String emailToUse = identifier;
  
  // Check if identifier is an email or artist name
  if (!identifier.contains('@')) {
    // It's an artist name - look up the email in Firestore
    final querySnapshot = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
        .collection('players')
        .where('artistName', isEqualTo: identifier)
        .limit(1)
        .get();
    
    if (querySnapshot.docs.isEmpty) {
      throw FirebaseAuthException(
        code: 'user-not-found',
        message: 'No artist found with name "$identifier"',
      );
    }
    
    // Get the email associated with this artist name
    final playerData = querySnapshot.docs.first.data();
    emailToUse = playerData['email'] as String;
  }
  
  // Sign in with email and password
  await FirebaseAuth.instance.signInWithEmailAndPassword(
    email: emailToUse,
    password: _passwordController.text,
  );
}
```

**UI Updates:**
- Changed label from "Email" to "Email or Artist Name"
- Changed icon from email to person outline
- Added helper text: "You can sign in with your email or artist name"
- Removed email format validation (allows any text)
- Updated validator message

**User Experience:**
- ✅ Login with email: `player@example.com`
- ✅ Login with artist name: `JaylenSky`
- ✅ Clear error if artist name not found
- ✅ Clear helper text guides users

**File Changed:** `lib/screens/auth_screen.dart`

## Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Error Message Design
- **Specific:** Each error code has unique message
- **Actionable:** Tells user what to do next
- **Visual:** Uses emoji indicators for quick recognition
- **Duration:** 4 seconds for comfortable reading
- **Tone:** Helpful, not accusatory

### 2. Async Safety
- Proper `mounted` checks before UI updates
- Prevents crashes during navigation
- Clean controller disposal
- Error handling at every async boundary

### 3. Database Queries
- Use correct field names (`artistName` not `displayName`)
- Limit queries to 1 result for efficiency
- Handle empty result sets gracefully
- Proper error catching for Firestore operations

### 4. User Flexibility
- Multiple login methods (email/name)
- Auto-detection of input type
- No forced email format validation on dual-use fields
- Clear UI hints guide users

### 5. Security Considerations
- Don't reveal if email exists on login failure
- Rate limiting respected ("too many attempts")
- Password strength enforced with clear guidance
- Disabled accounts handled properly

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Additions
1. **Password Reset Flow**
   - "Forgot Password?" link on login form
   - Email-based password reset
   - Clear instructions for reset process

2. **Artist Name Recovery**

   - Email lookup to remind user of their name

3. **Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Optional 2FA for enhanced security
   - SMS or authenticator app support

4. **Social Login**
   - Google Sign-In
   - Apple Sign-In
   - Maintain artist name flexibility

5. **Login History**
   - Show recent login attempts
   - Notify user of suspicious activity
   - Device management

## Deployment Notes

### Pre-Deployment
- ✅ All changes compile without errors
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing data structure
- ✅ Backward compatible (email login still works)
- ✅ Cloud Firestore rules support queries (check `artistName` index)

### Post-Deployment
- Monitor error logs for new edge cases
- Track login method usage (email vs artist name)
- Watch for Firestore query performance
- Gather user feedback on error messages

### Firestore Index Check
Ensure this index exists for optimal performance:
```
Collection: players
Fields: artistName (Ascending), email (Ascending)
Query scope: Collection
```

Create via Firebase Console or automatic index creation on first query.
