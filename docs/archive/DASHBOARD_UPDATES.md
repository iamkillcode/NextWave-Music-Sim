# 🔧 Dashboard Updates - October 14, 2025

## ✅ Changes Implemented

### 1. Fixed setState After Dispose Errors

**Issue**: Multiple setState calls happening after widget disposal, causing crashes and memory leaks.

**Fixed Locations**:

#### `_loadUserProfile()` Method
```dart
// Added mounted check after async Firebase call
if (!mounted) return;

if (doc.exists) {
  // ... setState safely executed
}
```

#### `_initializeOnlineMode()` Method
```dart
// Added mounted checks at critical points:
if (!mounted) return; // Before first setState

// ... async Firebase operations ...

if (!mounted) return; // After async, before setState

setState(() {
  _isOnlineMode = true;
  _isInitializing = false;
});
```

**Result**: ✅ No more setState errors on navigation or disposal

### 2. Removed Concert Feature

**Removed Components**:

#### UI Elements Removed:
- ❌ Concert action button (30 energy cost)
- ❌ "Concerts" stats card from dashboard
- ✅ Replaced with "Fanbase" card showing fan count

#### Code Removed:
```dart
// Removed concert button
_buildActionCard(
  'Concert',
  Icons.mic_rounded,
  const Color(0xFFFF6B9D),
  energyCost: 30,
  onTap: () => _performAction('concert'),
),
```

```dart
// Removed concert case from _performAction
case 'concert':
  // Concert logic removed
```

**Before**:
```
Dashboard Stats:
- Songs Written
- Albums Sold  
- Concerts ❌
- Energy
```

**After**:
```
Dashboard Stats:
- Songs Written
- Albums Sold  
- Fanbase ✅
- Energy
```

### 3. Energy Restoration System

**Current Implementation**: ✅ Already Working Correctly

Energy automatically restores to 100 every in-game day (every 1 real hour).

**How It Works**:
```dart
void _updateGameDate() async {
  // Check if day has changed
  if (newGameDate.day != currentGameDate.day || 
      newGameDate.month != currentGameDate.month || 
      newGameDate.year != currentGameDate.year) {
    
    // Replenish energy for the new day
    setState(() {
      artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
        energy: 100, // ✅ Full restore every game day
      );
    });
    
    _showMessage('☀️ New day! Energy fully restored to 100');
  }
}
```

**Timeline**:
```
Real Time  | Game Day | Energy Status
-----------|----------|---------------
10:00 AM   | Day 1    | 100 → drops as you play
11:00 AM   | Day 2    | 100 (restored!)
12:00 PM   | Day 3    | 100 (restored!)
1:00 PM    | Day 4    | 100 (restored!)
```

**No changes needed** - system already works as intended! ✅

## 🐛 Bug Fixes Applied

### Issue 1: setState After Dispose

```
DartError: setState() called after dispose()
```

**Files Modified**: 
- `_loadUserProfile()` - Line ~159
- `_initializeOnlineMode()` - Line ~2430

---

### Issue 2: RenderFlex Overflow
**Symptom**:
```
A RenderFlex overflowed by 5.6 pixels on the right
```

**Location**: Row at line 570 (status bar)

**Status**: ⚠️ Minor visual issue (not critical)

**Recommendation**: Consider using `Flexible` or `Expanded` widgets for responsive layout

---

### Issue 3: Duplicate GlobalKey
**Symptom**:
```
Duplicate GlobalKey detected in widget tree
```

**Status**: ⚠️ Warning only (not causing crashes)

**Recommendation**: Review keys in list items/repeated widgets
