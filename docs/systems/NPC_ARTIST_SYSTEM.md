# 🤖 NPC Artist System - Complete Implementation

**Date:** October 16, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED  
**Version:** Cloud Functions v2.1

---

## 🎯 What Are NPC Artists?

**NPC (Non-Player Character) Artists** are AI-controlled musicians that populate the game world, creating a **living, breathing music industry** where players compete against realistic competition.

### **Why NPCs Are Essential:**

❌ **Without NPCs:**
- Empty charts for new players
- No competition or context
- Boring single-player experience
- Can't test multiplayer features
- Game feels dead

✅ **With NPCs:**
- Always populated charts (even with 1 player!)
- Realistic competition and benchmarks
- Living music industry simulation
- Iconic characters with storylines
- Test environment works immediately

## 👥 NPC Categories

## ⚙️ How It Works

### **1. Initialization (One-Time Setup)**

```javascript
// Call this ONCE to create all NPCs
exports.initializeNPCArtists = functions.https.onCall(...)
```

**What It Does:**
- Creates 10 signature NPCs with full profiles and backstories
- Gives each NPC 3-10 initial songs (up to 6 months old)
- Calculates realistic stream counts based on tier
- Marks setup as complete (prevents duplicates)

**From Client (Admin Only):**
```dart
final result = await FirebaseFunctions.instance
    .httpsCallable('initializeNPCArtists')
    .call();

print(result.data); // { success: true, count: 100, ... }
```

---

### **2. Hourly Simulation (Automatic)**

```javascript
// Runs EVERY HOUR with dailyGameUpdate
exports.simulateNPCActivity = functions.pubsub.schedule('0 * * * *')...
```

**What It Does:**

#### **A. Update Streams (All NPCs)**
- Apply daily stream growth to all songs
- Growth based on:
  - `baseStreams` × `growthRate` × age decay × random variance
- Decay `last7DaysStreams` by 14.3% (1/7th per day)
- Songs get older (+1 day old)

#### **B. Release New Songs (Occasionally)**
- Check `daysSinceLastRelease` >= `releaseFrequency`
- 30% chance to release if eligible
- New song gets 10% of artist's base streams
- Updates `lastReleaseDate`

#### **C. Post on EchoX (Occasionally)**
- High activity NPCs: 15% chance per hour
- Medium activity: 5% chance
- Low activity: 2% chance
- Posts are marked as `isNPC: true`

#### **D. Update Career Stats**
- Recalculate `totalCareerStreams`
- Update `fanbase` (streams ÷ 100)
- Update `fame` (min 100, streams ÷ 100,000)

---

### **3. EchoX Integration**

**NPC Posts Include:**
- "Just dropped a new track! 🔥"
- "In the studio working on something special..."
- "USA stand up! 🙌"
- "New music coming soon 👀"
- Marked with `isNPC: true` field

**Players Can:**
- ✅ See NPC posts in feed
- ✅ Like NPC posts
- ✅ Echo (retweet) NPC posts
- ❌ Can't message NPCs (future feature)

---

## 📊 Chart Integration

### **Current Implementation:**

Charts pull from **players only**:
```dart
Query query = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('players')
    .orderBy('totalStreams', descending: true)
    .limit(100);
```

### **Updated Implementation (Required):**

Charts should pull from **both players AND NPCs**:

```dart
// Fetch real players
final playersQuery = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('players')
    .orderBy('totalStreams', descending: true)
    .limit(100);

// Fetch NPCs
final npcsQuery = FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('npc_artists')
    .where('isNPC', '==', true)
    .orderBy('totalCareerStreams', descending: true)
    .limit(100);

// Combine and sort
final allArtists = [...players, ...npcs]
    ..sort((a, b) => b.totalStreams.compareTo(a.totalStreams));

// Take top 100
final top100 = allArtists.take(100).toList();
```

### **UI Indicators:**

**Show NPC Badge:**
```dart
Row(
  children: [
    Text(artist.name),
    if (artist.isNPC) 
      Container(
        padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 4, vertical: 2),
        decoration: BoxDecoration(
          color: Colors.grey.shade700,
          borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(4),
        ),
        child: Text('NPC', style: TextStyle(fontSize: 10)),
      ),
  ],
)
```

**Filter Toggle:**
```dart
bool showOnlyRealPlayers = false;

// Filter logic
final filteredArtists = showOnlyRealPlayers
    ? allArtists.where((a) => !a.isNPC).toList()
    : allArtists;
```

---

## 🎮 Player Experience

### **First Day (Fresh Install):**

**Before NPCs:**
- Charts: Empty ❌
- Competition: None
- Context: Confusing

**With NPCs:**
- Charts: 100 artists immediately ✅
- Competition: Beat Jaylen Sky to reach #50!
- Context: "I'm competing in a real industry"

## 🚀 Deployment Steps

### **1. Deploy Updated Functions:**

```powershell
cd C:\Users\Manuel\Documents\GitHub\NextWave\nextwave\functions
firebase deploy --only functions
```

**New Functions:**
- `initializeNPCArtists` (HTTP Callable - one-time)
- `simulateNPCActivity` (Scheduled - hourly)

---

### **2. Initialize NPCs (First Time):**

**From Client (Admin Panel):**
```dart
// Add to dashboard admin section
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    final result = await FirebaseFunctions.instance
        .httpsCallable('initializeNPCArtists')
        .call();
    
    if (result.data['success']) {
      print('✅ Created ${result.data['count']} NPCs');
    }
  },
  child: Text('Initialize NPC Artists'),
),
```

**Or From Firebase Console:**
- Go to Cloud Functions
- Find `initializeNPCArtists`
- Click "Test" tab
- Run with empty data `{}`

---

### **3. Update Chart Queries:**

Update all chart screens to include NPCs:

**Files to Modify:**
- `lib/screens/regional_charts_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/leaderboard_screen.dart`
- `lib/screens/spotlight_charts_screen.dart`

**Query Pattern:**
```dart
// Before: Only players
final players = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('players')
    .orderBy('totalStreams', descending: true)
    .get();

// After: Players + NPCs
final players = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('players')
    .orderBy('totalStreams', descending: true)
    .get();

final npcs = await FirebaseFirestore.instance
    .collection('npc_artists')
    .where('isNPC', '==', true)
    .get();

final allArtists = [
  ...players.docs.map((d) => {...d.data(), 'id': d.id, 'isNPC': false}),
  ...npcs.docs.map((d) => {...d.data(), 'id': d.id}),
];

// Sort and take top N
allArtists.sort((a, b) => 
  b['totalCareerStreams'].compareTo(a['totalCareerStreams']));
```

---

### **4. Add NPC Indicators:**

```dart
// In chart tile widget
if (artist['isNPC'] == true)
  Container(
    margin: EdgeInsets.only(left: 4),
    padding: EdgeInsets.symmetric(horizontal: 6, vertical: 2),
    decoration: BoxDecoration(
      color: Colors.grey.shade700,
      borderRadius: BorderRadius.circular(4),
    ),
    child: Text(
      'NPC',
      style: TextStyle(
        color: Colors.white70,
        fontSize: 9,
        fontWeight: FontWeight.bold,
      ),
    ),
  ),
```

---

### **5. Add Filter Toggle:**

```dart
// In chart screen state
bool _showOnlyRealPlayers = false;

// In AppBar actions
IconButton(
  icon: Icon(_showOnlyRealPlayers ? Icons.people : Icons.people_outline),
  onPressed: () {
    setState(() {
      _showOnlyRealPlayers = !_showOnlyRealPlayers;
    });
  },
  tooltip: _showOnlyRealPlayers ? 'Show All Artists' : 'Show Only Real Players',
),
```

---
