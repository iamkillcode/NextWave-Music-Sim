# 🎸 Genre Mastery System - REBALANCED v2.0

## Major Changes

The genre mastery system has been **completely rebalanced** to:
1. ✅ Require **~30 songs** to reach 100% mastery (was ~3-6 songs)
2. ✅ Make mastery **directly boost song quality** (up to +30%)
3. ✅ Make mastery **directly boost stream growth** (up to +50%)

---

## 🎯 New Mastery Formula

### Mastery Gain Calculation

**Formula:** `Mastery Gain = (Effort × 1.5) + (Quality / 100 × 4.5)`

**Range:** 1.5 - 10.5 points per song (average ~3-4 points)

**Breakdown:**

| Component | Old System | New System | Change |
|-----------|-----------|------------|---------|
| Base Gain (Effort) | Effort × 5 | Effort × 1.5 | **÷3.3x slower** |
| Quality Bonus | Quality × 15% | Quality × 4.5% | **÷3.3x slower** |
| Min Gain | 5 points | 1.5 points | **÷3.3x slower** |
| Max Gain | 35 points | 10.5 points | **÷3.3x slower** |

**Progression Speed:**

| Song Type | Points/Song | Songs to Master |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| Quick (Effort 1, Quality 40) | ~3 points | **~33 songs** |
| Standard (Effort 2, Quality 50) | ~5 points | **~20 songs** |
| Quality (Effort 3, Quality 70) | ~8 points | **~13 songs** |
| Maxed (Effort 4, Quality 90) | ~10 points | **~10 songs** |

**Average:** Most players writing mixed-quality songs = **~25-30 songs to master**

## 🚀 Mastery Benefits

### 1. Song Quality Boost (NEW!)

**Location:** `lib/models/artist_stats.dart` - `calculateSongQuality()`

**Formula:** `Quality Multiplier = 1.0 + (Mastery / 100 × 0.3)`

**Effect:**
```
  0% mastery = 1.0x   (no bonus)
 25% mastery = 1.075x (+7.5% quality)
 50% mastery = 1.15x  (+15% quality)
 75% mastery = 1.225x (+22.5% quality)
100% mastery = 1.3x   (+30% quality boost!)
```

**Example:**
- Player with 50 songwriting skill writes Hip Hop song
- **0% Hip Hop mastery:** Song quality = 50
- **50% Hip Hop mastery:** Song quality = 50 × 1.15 = **57.5** (+7.5 points!)
- **100% Hip Hop mastery:** Song quality = 50 × 1.3 = **65** (+15 points!)

**Impact:** Mastering a genre makes every song noticeably better!

---

### 2. Stream Growth Boost (NEW!)

**Location:** `lib/services/stream_growth_service.dart` - `calculateDailyStreamGrowth()`

**Formula:** `Stream Multiplier = 1.0 + (Mastery / 100 × 0.5)`

**Effect:**
```
  0% mastery = 1.0x   (no bonus)
 25% mastery = 1.125x (+12.5% streams)
 50% mastery = 1.25x  (+25% streams)
 75% mastery = 1.375x (+37.5% streams)
100% mastery = 1.5x   (+50% streams boost!)
```

**Example:**
- Song getting 1,000 streams/day normally
- **0% mastery:** 1,000 streams/day
- **50% mastery:** 1,000 × 1.25 = **1,250 streams/day** (+250!)
- **100% mastery:** 1,000 × 1.5 = **1,500 streams/day** (+500!)

**Why This Matters:**
- Algorithms recommend songs from mastered genres more
- Fans trust artists who specialize
- Streaming platforms prioritize genre experts
- Viral potential increases with mastery
