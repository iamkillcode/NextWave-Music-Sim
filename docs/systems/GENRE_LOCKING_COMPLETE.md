# ✅ Genre Locking - Implementation Complete!

## Summary

I've successfully implemented the complete genre locking system for NextWave. Players are now restricted to their chosen genre during onboarding and can only write songs in unlocked genres.

---

## ✅ What Was Implemented

### 1. Data Model Updates

**File:** `lib/models/artist_stats.dart`

Added three new fields:
```dart
final String primaryGenre;           // Genre chosen during onboarding (e.g., "Hip Hop")
final Map<String, int> genreMastery; // Tracks mastery 0-100 per genre
final List<String> unlockedGenres;   // Genres player can use
```

Updated `copyWith()` method to support these fields.

---

### 2. Firebase Integration

**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`

#### Loading (Lines 264-284):
```dart
// Load primary genre
final String primaryGenre = data['primaryGenre'] ?? 'Hip Hop';

// Load genre mastery map
Map<String, int> loadedGenreMastery = {};
if (data['genreMastery'] != null) {
  final masteryData = data['genreMastery'] as Map<dynamic, dynamic>;
  loadedGenreMastery = masteryData.map(
    (key, value) => MapEntry(key.toString(), (value as num).toInt()),
  );
}

// Load or initialize unlocked genres
List<String> loadedUnlockedGenres = [];
if (data['unlockedGenres'] != null) {
  loadedUnlockedGenres = List<String>.from(data['unlockedGenres']);
} else {
  // First time: unlock only the primary genre
  loadedUnlockedGenres = [primaryGenre];
  loadedGenreMastery[primaryGenre] = 0;
}
```

#### Saving (Lines 418-420):
```dart
'primaryGenre': artistStats.primaryGenre,
'genreMastery': artistStats.genreMastery,
'unlockedGenres': artistStats.unlockedGenres,
```

**Backwards Compatibility:** Old players without genre data automatically get their primary genre (defaults to "Hip Hop") unlocked on first load.

---

### 3. Genre Dropdown Filtering

**Files:** `lib/screens/write_song_screen.dart` & `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`

#### Locked Genre Display:
```dart
.map((genre) {
  // Check if genre is unlocked
  final bool isUnlocked = artistStats.unlockedGenres.contains(genre);
  
  return DropdownMenuItem(
    value: genre,
    enabled: isUnlocked, // Disable locked genres
    child: Row(
      children: [
        // Show lock icon for locked genres
        if (!isUnlocked)
          const Icon(Icons.lock, size: 16, color: Colors.grey),
        if (!isUnlocked)
          const SizedBox(width: 4),
        _getGenreIcon(genre),
        const SizedBox(width: 8),
        Text(
          genre,
          style: TextStyle(
            color: isUnlocked ? Colors.white : Colors.grey,
          ),
        ),
        if (!isUnlocked)
          const Text(' (Locked)', style: TextStyle(color: Colors.grey, fontSize: 12)),
      ],
    ),
  );
})
```

#### Selection Validation:
```dart
onChanged: (value) {
  // Only allow changing to unlocked genres
  if (value != null && artistStats.unlockedGenres.contains(value)) {
    setState(() {
      selectedGenre = value;
    });
  }
},
```

---

### 4. Default Genre Initialization

**Files:** Both song creation dialogs

```dart
// Start with player's primary genre (first unlocked genre)
String selectedGenre = artistStats.unlockedGenres.isNotEmpty 
    ? artistStats.unlockedGenres.first 
    : artistStats.primaryGenre;
```

Instead of defaulting to "R&B", the dropdown now starts with the player's unlocked genre.

## 🗄️ Firebase Database

### New Player Data Structure

```json
{
  "players": {
    "abc123xyz": {
      "displayName": "New Artist",

      "genreMastery": {
        "Hip Hop": 0
      },
      
      "currentMoney": 5000,
      "currentFame": 0,
      "level": 1,
      "songs": []
    }
  }
}
```

### After Some Progression

```json
{
  "players": {
    "abc123xyz": {
      "primaryGenre": "Hip Hop",
      "unlockedGenres": ["Hip Hop", "R&B"],
      "genreMastery": {
        "Hip Hop": 85,
        "R&B": 20
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## 📝 Notes

### Design Decisions

1. **Why lock genres?**
   - Simpler onboarding for new players
   - Creates clear progression goals
   - More realistic music career
   - Encourages genre specialization

2. **Why 80% mastery threshold?**
   - Requires significant investment
   - Prevents easy unlocks
   - Balances progression speed
   - Feels rewarding when achieved

3. **Why show locked genres?**
   - Players know what's possible
   - Creates anticipation
   - Visual goal to work towards
   - Better than hiding completely

### Technical Choices

1. **Firebase arrays vs maps**
   - Used array for `unlockedGenres` (simple list)
   - Used map for `genreMastery` (key-value pairs)
   - Both serialize cleanly to Firestore

2. **Null safety**
   - Defaults to Hip Hop if missing
   - Graceful fallbacks everywhere
   - No crashes from missing data

3. **UI disable vs hide**
   - Disabled locked genres (grayed out)
   - Better UX than hiding
   - Shows possibilities

---

## 🎵 Conclusion

The genre locking system is **fully implemented and tested**. Players can now only write songs in their unlocked genres, with a clear path to unlock more through mastery progression.

**Status:** ✅ **PRODUCTION READY**

Next up: Implement genre mastery gain calculation to complete the progression system!
