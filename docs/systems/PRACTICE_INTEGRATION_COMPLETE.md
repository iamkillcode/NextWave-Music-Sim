# Practice System Integration - Complete ‚úÖ

## Implementation Summary

The practice system has been fully integrated into the game with realistic costs, waiting periods, and backend persistence.

---

## What Was Built

### 1. PendingPractice Model (`lib/models/pending_practice.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Track training programs in progress
- **Fields**:
  - `practiceType`: 'songwriting', 'lyrics', 'composition', 'inspiration'
  - `startDate`: When training began
  - `durationDays`: How many game days it takes (2-7 days)
  - `skillGain`: Skill points awarded on completion
  - `xpGain`: Experience points awarded
  - `moneyCost`: Upfront payment amount
- **Methods**:
  - `isComplete(currentDate)`: Check if training is finished
  - `getRemainingDays(currentDate)`: Days left
  - `toMap()` / `fromMap()`: Firestore serialization
  - Display getters: `displayName`, `emoji`, `colorHex`

### 2. Practice Screen (`lib/screens/practice_screen.dart`)
- **700+ lines, zero compilation errors**
- **Training Programs**:
  | Program | Cost | Energy | Duration | Reward |
  |---------|------|--------|----------|---------|
  | Songwriting Workshop | $500 | -10 | 3 days | +4 Songwriting, +25 XP |
  | Lyrics Masterclass | $800 | -15 | 7 days | +6 Lyrics, +35 XP |
  | Music Theory Course | $1000 | -25 | 5 days | +15 Composition, +40 XP |
  | Creative Retreat | $600 | -20 | 2 days | +20 Inspiration, +20 XP |

- **Features**:
  - Pending practices display with progress bars
  - Real-time remaining days countdown
  - Stats preview card (current skills)
  - Training option cards with requirements
  - Enrollment validation (money, energy, max 3 active)
  - Confirmation dialog with cost breakdown
  - Callbacks for stats/practice updates

### 3. Dashboard Integration (`lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`)
- **Added**:
  - `List<PendingPractice> pendingPractices = []` state variable
  - Import for `pending_practice.dart`

- **New Methods**:
  - `_loadPendingPractices()`: Load from Firestore on profile load
  - `_savePendingPractices()`: Save to Firestore
  - `_checkCompletedPractices()`: Detect completed training, apply skills

- **Integration Points**:
  - Load practices after profile loads
  - Check completions on startup
  - Check completions when day changes (after energy restore)
  - Save practices with profile updates
  - Callback to add new practices when enrolled

### 4. Activity Hub Update (`lib/screens/activity_hub_screen.dart`)
- **Added Parameters**:
  - `List<PendingPractice> pendingPractices`
  - `Function(PendingPractice) onPracticeStarted`

- **Navigation**:
  - Practice card now passes all required parameters to PracticeScreen
  - Includes pending practices, callback, and current game date

## Data Flow

### 1. **Starting Training**
```
User clicks "Enroll" in PracticeScreen
‚Üí Validates requirements (money, energy, max 3 active)
‚Üí Shows confirmation dialog
‚Üí Deducts money/energy immediately
‚Üí Creates PendingPractice object
‚Üí Calls onPracticeStarted callback
‚Üí Dashboard adds to pendingPractices list
‚Üí Saves to Firestore (pendingPractices field)
‚Üí Returns to Activity Hub with updated state
```

### 2. **Session Persistence**
```
User closes app
‚Üí pendingPractices saved in Firestore
‚Üí User reopens app days later
‚Üí Dashboard loads profile
‚Üí _loadPendingPractices() restores training state
‚Üí _checkCompletedPractices() detects finished programs
‚Üí Skills automatically applied
‚Üí Notification shown to user
```

### 3. **Day Changes**
```
Game time advances to new day
‚Üí _updateGameDate() detects day change
‚Üí Energy restored to 100
‚Üí _checkCompletedPractices() called
‚Üí Completed practices detected
‚Üí Skills applied via copyWith()
‚Üí Practices removed from list
‚Üí State saved to Firestore
‚Üí User notified of completion
```

## Balance & Design Notes

### Pricing Philosophy
- **$500-$1000 range**: Significant investment, not trivial
- **Forces choice**: Can't spam all courses
- **Side hustles connection**: Earns $300/day, so 2-3 days work = 1 course

### Energy Cost
- **10-25 energy**: Meaningful but not crippling
- **Multiple enrollments**: Can start 2-3 on same day if full energy
- **Recovery**: 1 energy per real minute, or full restore on new day

### Wait Times
- **2-7 days**: Short enough to feel progress, long enough to feel invested
- **Real-time**: With 15min = 1 day, that's 30min - 1hr 45min real time
- **Staggering**: Encourages enrolling in multiple programs on different days

### Skill Gains
- **+4 to +15 per skill**: Noticeable improvement
- **Scales with cost**: More expensive = more gain
- **XP bonus**: Levels up faster with training
- **Long-term**: 10 courses = ~50+ skill points
