# Authentication Persistence Setup

## Overview
Firebase Authentication now persists user login state across hot reloads, app restarts, and browser sessions. Users will remain logged in even after closing and reopening the app.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Firebase Auth Persistence Configuration** (`main.dart`)
```dart
await FirebaseAuth.instance.setPersistence(Persistence.LOCAL);
```

**What it does:**
- Sets Firebase Auth to use `LOCAL` persistence mode
- Stores auth tokens in browser's localStorage (for web) or secure storage (mobile)
- Auth state survives browser refresh, hot reload, and app restarts

**Persistence Modes:**
- `LOCAL`: Persists across sessions (what we're using)
- `SESSION`: Only persists for current tab session
- `NONE`: No persistence (cleared immediately)

### 2. **StreamBuilder Auth State Listener** (`main.dart`)
```dart
return StreamBuilder<User?>(
  stream: FirebaseAuth.instance.authStateChanges(),
  builder: (context, snapshot) {
    // Automatically routes user based on auth state
  },
);
```

**What it does:**
- Listens to real-time authentication state changes
- Automatically updates UI when user logs in/out
- Handles initial auth check on app startup
- Shows loading screen while checking auth state

## How It Works

### On App Startup:
1. Firebase initializes with persistence set to LOCAL
2. StreamBuilder checks for existing auth token in localStorage
3. If token exists and is valid:
   - User is automatically signed in
   - Dashboard loads immediately
4. If no token or invalid:
   - Auth screen is shown

### After Login:
1. Firebase Auth stores the token in localStorage
2. Token remains stored even after:
   - Hot reload (during development)
   - App restart
   - Browser refresh
   - Browser close/reopen

### After Hot Reload (Development):
1. StreamBuilder reconnects to auth state
2. Existing token is checked
3. User remains logged in
4. No need to sign in again

## Benefits

✅ **No More Repeated Login**: Users stay logged in across development sessions
✅ **Better UX**: Real users don't need to log in every time they visit
✅ **Automatic State Management**: StreamBuilder handles routing automatically
✅ **Secure**: Uses Firebase's secure token storage
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Works on Web, iOS, Android, Windows

## Testing

### To Test Persistence:
1. Run the app: `flutter run -d chrome`
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Try these scenarios:
   - Hot reload (r in terminal)
   - Full restart (R in terminal)
   - Close browser and reopen
   - Navigate to different pages and back

### Expected Behavior:
- User should remain logged in in ALL scenarios above
- No auth screen should appear after initial login
- Dashboard loads directly

### To Test Logout:
1. Use the logout button in Settings
2. User should be redirected to auth screen
3. Auth token should be cleared
4. Reopening app should show auth screen

## Troubleshooting

### If user gets logged out after hot reload:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify Firebase is properly initialized
3. Check that `Persistence.LOCAL` is set
4. Clear browser cache and try again

### If user can't log in:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify Firebase credentials in `firebase_options.dart`
3. Check Firebase Console for auth issues
4. Look for errors in browser console

### For Development:
If you need to clear auth for testing:
```dart
await FirebaseAuth.instance.signOut();
```
Or clear browser localStorage manually in DevTools

## Security Notes

- Auth tokens are stored securely by Firebase SDK
- Tokens expire automatically after a period of inactivity
- Users can force logout from Settings screen
- Token storage follows platform security best practices

## Platform-Specific Details

### Web (Chrome):
- Uses browser's localStorage
- Persists across browser sessions
- Cleared when user clears browser data

### Windows:
- Uses Windows secure credential storage
- Persists across app restarts

### Android:
- Uses Android Keystore
- Persists across app restarts

### iOS:
- Uses iOS Keychain
- Persists across app restarts
