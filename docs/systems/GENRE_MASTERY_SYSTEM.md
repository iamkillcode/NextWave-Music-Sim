# 🎸 Genre Mastery System - Complete Implementation

## Overview

The **Genre Mastery System** tracks how skilled a player becomes at each music genre through practice. Every time a player writes a song in a genre, they gain mastery points (0-100 scale). Higher mastery leads to better song quality and unlocks advanced features.

**Note:** Genre mastery progression is independent of genre unlocking. Players gain mastery in their unlocked genres, but the unlock mechanism will be implemented separately.

## 🎯 Core Mechanics

### Mastery Calculation Formula

**Base Formula:**
```dart
Mastery Gain = (Effort Level × 5) + (Song Quality / 100 × 15)
```

**Components:**
1. **Effort Level** (1-4):
   - Minimal Effort (1) = 5 base points
   - Low Effort (2) = 10 base points
   - Medium Effort (3) = 15 base points
   - Maximum Effort (4) = 20 base points

2. **Quality Bonus** (0-15):
   - Based on final song quality (0-100)
   - Formula: `(quality / 100) × 15`
   - Examples:
     - 50 quality song = +7.5 bonus → +7 points
     - 80 quality song = +12 bonus points
     - 100 quality song = +15 bonus points

3. **Total Range:** 5-35 points per song
   - Minimum: Effort 1 + 0% quality = 5 points
   - Maximum: Effort 4 + 100% quality = 35 points
   - Clamped to prevent too fast/slow progression

| 10-19     | Novice      | Learning the basics |
| 20-29     | Learning    | Getting comfortable |
| 30-39     | Intermediate| Developing skills |
| 40-49     | Competent   | Solid foundation |
| 50-59     | Skilled     | Confident in genre |
| 60-69     | Proficient  | Strong command |
| 70-79     | Advanced    | Near mastery |

## 💻 Code Implementation

### Model: ArtistStats (`lib/models/artist_stats.dart`)

#### New Methods Added:

**1. Calculate Mastery Gain**
```dart
int calculateGenreMasteryGain(String genre, int effortLevel, double songQuality) {
  // Base gain from effort (1-4 effort = 5-20 base points)
  int baseGain = effortLevel * 5;

  // Quality bonus (0-15 points based on song quality)
  int qualityBonus = (songQuality / 100 * 15).round();

  // Total gain (clamped to 5-35 range)
  int totalGain = (baseGain + qualityBonus).clamp(5, 35);

  return totalGain;
}
```

**2. Apply Mastery Gain**
```dart
Map<String, int> applyGenreMasteryGain(String genre, int masteryGain) {
  Map<String, int> updatedMastery = Map.from(genreMastery);
  int currentMastery = updatedMastery[genre] ?? 0;
  int newMastery = (currentMastery + masteryGain).clamp(0, 100);
  updatedMastery[genre] = newMastery;
  return updatedMastery;
}
```

**3. Get Mastery Level Title**
```dart
String getGenreMasteryLevel(String genre) {
  int mastery = genreMastery[genre] ?? 0;
  if (mastery >= 90) return "Master";
  if (mastery >= 80) return "Expert";
  if (mastery >= 70) return "Advanced";
  if (mastery >= 60) return "Proficient";
  if (mastery >= 50) return "Skilled";
  if (mastery >= 40) return "Competent";
  if (mastery >= 30) return "Intermediate";
  if (mastery >= 20) return "Learning";
  if (mastery >= 10) return "Novice";
  return "Beginner";
}
```

### Song Creation Integration

Mastery gain is applied in **4 locations** where songs are created:

#### 1. Write Song Screen - Quick Write
**File:** `lib/screens/write_song_screen.dart` (Line ~360)

```dart
void _writeSong(Map<String, dynamic> songType) {
  // ... existing quality/skill calculations ...
  
  // Calculate genre mastery gain
  int masteryGain = artistStats.calculateGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    effort,
    songQuality,
  );
  Map<String, int> updatedMastery = artistStats.applyGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    masteryGain,
  );

  setState(() {
    artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
      // ... other fields ...
      genreMastery: updatedMastery,  // ✅ Added
    );
  });
}
```

#### 2. Write Song Screen - Custom Write
**File:** `lib/screens/write_song_screen.dart` (Line ~970)

```dart
void _createCustomSong(String title, String genre, int effort) {
  // ... existing quality/skill calculations ...
  
  // Calculate genre mastery gain
  int masteryGain = artistStats.calculateGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    effort,
    songQuality,
  );
  Map<String, int> updatedMastery = artistStats.applyGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    masteryGain,
  );

  setState(() {
    artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
      // ... other fields ...
      genreMastery: updatedMastery,  // ✅ Added
    );
  });
}
```

#### 3. Dashboard - Quick Write
**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart` (Line ~2340)

```dart
void _writeSong(Map<String, dynamic> songType) {
  // ... existing quality/skill calculations ...
  
  // Calculate genre mastery gain
  int masteryGain = artistStats.calculateGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    effort,
    songQuality,
  );
  Map<String, int> updatedMastery = artistStats.applyGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    masteryGain,
  );

  setState(() {
    artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
      // ... other fields ...
      genreMastery: updatedMastery,  // ✅ Added
    );
  });
}
```

#### 4. Dashboard - Custom Write
**File:** `lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart` (Line ~2940)

```dart
void _createCustomSong(String title, String genre, int effort) {
  // ... existing quality/skill calculations ...
  
  // Calculate genre mastery gain
  int masteryGain = artistStats.calculateGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    effort,
    songQuality,
  );
  Map<String, int> updatedMastery = artistStats.applyGenreMasteryGain(
    genre,
    masteryGain,
  );

  setState(() {
    artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(
      // ... other fields ...
      genreMastery: updatedMastery,  // ✅ Added
    );
  });
}
```

## 📐 Balance Considerations

### Progression Speed

**Current Rate:**
- **Casual Player** (Effort 2, Quality 50): ~17 points/song
  - 0% → 100% = ~6 songs
  
- **Serious Player** (Effort 3, Quality 70): ~26 points/song
  - 0% → 100% = ~4 songs

- **Min-Maxer** (Effort 4, Quality 90): ~33 points/song
  - 0% → 100% = ~3 songs

**Tuning Options:**
1. **Too Fast?** Reduce quality bonus multiplier (15 → 10)
2. **Too Slow?** Increase base gain multiplier (5 → 6)
3. **More Variance?** Add random ±3 points per song

### Skill Synergy

**Mastery vs General Skills:**
- **General Skills** (songwriting, lyrics, composition): Affect ALL genres
- **Genre Mastery:** Only affects specific genre

**Example:**
- Player with 50 songwriting, 30 Hip Hop mastery
- Hip Hop song quality: Based on songwriting (primary) + mastery bonus (secondary)

---

## 🎓 Design Philosophy

### Why This System?

1. **Progressive Specialization**
   - Players start focused on one genre
   - Gradually master additional genres
   - Creates sense of expertise and growth

2. **Effort-Reward Balance**
   - High effort songs give more mastery
   - Quality matters (encourages skill development)
   - Prevents grinding low-effort spam

3. **Accessible But Deep**
   - Simple to understand (0-100%)
   - Complex enough for engagement
   - Clear progression milestones

4. **Respects Player Time**
   - 3-6 songs to master = ~30-60 minutes
   - Not too grindy
   - Feels rewarding quickly

---

## 📝 Notes

### Mastery vs Unlocking

**Important:** Genre mastery does NOT automatically unlock new genres. The unlock system will be implemented separately and may use:
- Achievements/quests
- In-game currency purchases
- Collaboration with NPCs
- Chart success milestones
- Level requirements

This keeps progression flexible and allows for various unlock mechanics.

### Backwards Compatibility

Old player saves without mastery data automatically get:
```dart
genreMastery[primaryGenre] = 0;
```

This ensures existing players start tracking mastery from their current state without data loss.

---

## ✅ Implementation Status

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE - READY FOR TESTING**

### Completed:
- ✅ Model methods added (calculate, apply, get level)
- ✅ Quick write integration (2 locations)
- ✅ Custom write integration (2 locations)
- ✅ Firebase save/load
- ✅ Backwards compatibility
- ✅ Zero compilation errors
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Next Steps:
1. 🧪 **Test in-game:** Create songs, verify mastery increases
2. 🧪 **Test persistence:** Logout/login, check mastery saved
3. 🎨 **Add UI:** Display mastery in Skills screen
4. 🎮 **Show feedback:** Add mastery gain to success messages
