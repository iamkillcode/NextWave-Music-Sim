## ⚡ Current Time Configuration

### Core Formula
```
1 real second = 24 game seconds
1 real minute = 24 game minutes  
1 real hour = 1 game day (24 hours)
```

### Conversion Table
| Real Time | Game Time Passed |
|-----------|------------------|
| 1 second | 24 seconds |
| 1 minute | 24 minutes |
| 2.5 minutes | 1 game hour |
| 1 hour | 1 game day |
| 1 day (24h) | 24 game days |
| 1 week | ~5.5 game months |
| 1 month | ~2 game years |

---

## 🏗️ System Architecture

### 1. **Firebase Anchor (Firestore)**
```javascript
gameSettings/globalTime {
  realWorldStartDate: October 1, 2025 00:00
  gameWorldStartDate: January 1, 2020
  hoursPerDay: 1
  description: "1 real world hour equals 1 in-game day"
}
```

**Purpose**: 
- Acts as universal reference point for all players
- Prevents device time manipulation
- Ensures synchronized multiplayer experience

### 2. **Local Calculation (Every Second)**
```dart
void _updateGameTime() {
  // Time since last Firebase sync
  final realSecondsSinceSync = DateTime.now().difference(_lastSyncTime!).inSeconds;
  
  // Convert: 1 real second = 24 game seconds
  final gameSecondsToAdd = realSecondsSinceSync * 24;
  
  // Add to last known sync point
  final newGameDate = currentGameDate.add(Duration(seconds: gameSecondsToAdd));
  
  setState(() {
    currentGameDate = newGameDate;
  });
}
```

**Benefits**:
- Smooth UI updates (every 1 second)
- No network lag for display
- Minimal Firebase reads
- Efficient performance

### 3. **Periodic Synchronization**
- **Initial sync**: When app launches
- **Timer**: Updates every 1 second locally
- **Firebase sync**: Checks server time periodically
- **Drift correction**: Regular syncs keep players aligned

---

## ✅ What's Working Well

### 1. **Server-Side Authority**
```dart
// Uses Firebase server timestamp, not device time
final serverTimeRef = _firestore.collection('serverTime').doc('current');
await serverTimeRef.set({'timestamp': FieldValue.serverTimestamp()});
final serverTimestamp = serverTimeDoc.data()?['timestamp'] as Timestamp?;
final now = serverTimestamp?.toDate() ?? DateTime.now();
```
✅ Prevents cheating via device clock manipulation  
✅ Ensures all players calculate from same moment  
✅ Provides authoritative time source

### 2. **Efficient Update Strategy**
- **Local updates**: Every 1 second (no network)
- **Firebase sync**: Only when needed
- **Passive income**: Calculated based on elapsed real seconds
- **Energy regeneration**: Triggers on day change

✅ Smooth display without lag  
✅ Minimal Firebase reads  
✅ Battery-efficient  
✅ Network-friendly

### 3. **Passive Income Integration**
```dart
void _calculatePassiveIncome(int realSecondsPassed) {
  // Scales with real time elapsed
  final streamsGained = (scaledStreams * realSecondsPassed).round();
}
```
✅ Works even when offline  
✅ Fair calculation (time-based)  
✅ Prevents exploitation  
✅ Realistic streaming simulation

### 4. **Energy System Integration**
```dart
// Check if a new day has started
final currentDay = newGameDate.day;
if (currentDay != _lastEnergyReplenishDay) {
  // Fully replenish energy every game day
  artistStats = artistStats.copyWith(energy: 100);
}
```
✅ Automatic daily regeneration  
✅ Works offline  
✅ Clear player communication  
✅ Prevents edge cases

### 5. **UI Display**
```dart
// Top status bar shows:
🌍 15:42              1h = 1 day ⚡
   January 15, 2020     
```
✅ Clear time display  
✅ Shows current game date  
✅ Explains conversion rate  
✅ Globe icon indicates sync

### Synchronization Flow

```
Player A loads app:
  1. Get Firebase anchor: Oct 1, 2025 00:00 → Jan 1, 2020
  2. Get server time: Oct 13, 2025 15:30 (now)
  3. Calculate: 312 hours × 24 = 312 game days
  4. Result: Jan 1, 2020 + 312 days = Nov 8, 2020
  5. Store sync point: _lastSyncTime = Oct 13, 15:30

Every second after:
  1. Calculate: Now - lastSync = X seconds
  2. Convert: X seconds × 24 = Y game seconds
  3. Update: Nov 8, 2020 + Y seconds
  4. No Firebase call needed!

Player B loads app (same time):
  1. Gets same anchor point
  2. Gets same server time
  3. Calculates same game date: Nov 8, 2020 ✅
  4. Both players perfectly synchronized!

## 🔧 Potential Optimizations

### 1. **Reduce Firebase Writes** (Minor)

**Current**:
```dart
// Creates a document every sync just to get timestamp
final serverTimeRef = _firestore.collection('serverTime').doc('current');
await serverTimeRef.set({'timestamp': FieldValue.serverTimestamp()});
```

**Optimization**:
```dart
// Use a single document that all clients update
// Or use Firestore's built-in server timestamp in queries
final doc = await _firestore.collection('gameSettings').doc('globalTime').get();
final lastUpdated = doc.data()?['lastUpdated'] as Timestamp?;
```

**Impact**: Reduces writes from ~120/hour to ~1/hour per player  
**Priority**: 🟡 Low (current method works fine)

---

### 2. **Cache Optimization** (Optional)

**Current**: Fetches from Firebase each sync

**Enhancement**:
```dart
// Cache anchor point locally after first fetch
SharedPreferences prefs = await SharedPreferences.getInstance();
if (prefs.containsKey('cached_anchor')) {
  // Use cached values, only sync periodically
}
```

**Impact**: Faster initial load, fewer network calls  
**Priority**: 🟡 Low (current speed is acceptable)

---

### 3. **Adaptive Sync Frequency** (Advanced)

**Current**: Fixed sync interval

**Enhancement**:
```dart
// Sync more often when active, less when idle
if (userIsActivelyPlaying) {
  syncInterval = Duration(minutes: 5);
} else {
  syncInterval = Duration(minutes: 30);
}
```

**Impact**: Better battery life, maintains accuracy  
**Priority**: 🟢 Medium (nice to have for mobile)
