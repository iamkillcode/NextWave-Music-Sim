# ✅ Genre Mastery - Implementation Complete!

## Summary

Genre mastery gain calculation is now **fully implemented**! Every time a player writes a song, they gain mastery (0-100%) in that genre based on effort level and song quality.

---

## 🎯 What It Does

**Players gain mastery** by writing songs in a genre:
- **Quick songs** (low effort) = 10-20 mastery points
- **Custom songs** (medium effort) = 15-25 mastery points  
- **Max effort songs** = 20-35 mastery points
- **Quality bonus** = Up to +15 points for excellent songs

**Progression Speed:**
- Casual players: ~6 songs to master (0% → 100%)
- Serious players: ~4 songs to master
- Min-maxers: ~3 songs to master

### Files Modified (3):

1. **`lib/models/artist_stats.dart`**
   - Added `calculateGenreMasteryGain()` method
   - Added `applyGenreMasteryGain()` method
   - Added `getGenreMasteryLevel()` method

2. **`lib/screens/write_song_screen.dart`**
   - Integrated mastery gain in quick write function
   - Integrated mastery gain in custom write function
   - Updates `genreMastery` map on song creation

3. **`lib/screens/dashboard_screen_new.dart`**
   - Integrated mastery gain in dashboard quick write
   - Integrated mastery gain in dashboard custom write
   - Updates `genreMastery` map on song creation

---

## 📐 Formula

```dart
Mastery Gain = (Effort × 5) + (Quality / 100 × 15)

Range: 5-35 points per song
Mastery Cap: 100% maximum
```

**Examples:**
- Effort 2, Quality 50 = 10 + 7.5 = **~17 points**
- Effort 3, Quality 70 = 15 + 10.5 = **~26 points**
- Effort 4, Quality 90 = 20 + 13.5 = **~33 points**

---

## 🗄️ Firebase

**Mastery data already saves/loads:**
```json
{
  "genreMastery": {
    "Hip Hop": 75,
    "R&B": 45,
    "Trap": 20
  }
}
```

✅ Backwards compatible (old saves get default 0%)

---

## 🎮 How It Works

### Example: New Player Learning Hip Hop

**Song 1:** Quick Write (Effort 2, Quality 45)
- Gain: +17 points
- Mastery: **17% (Novice)**

**Song 2:** Custom Write (Effort 3, Quality 60)
- Gain: +24 points
- Mastery: **41% (Competent)**

**Song 3:** Max Effort (Effort 4, Quality 85)
- Gain: +33 points
- Mastery: **74% (Advanced)**

**Song 4:** Legendary Song (Effort 4, Quality 95)
- Gain: +34 points
- Mastery: **100% (Master)** ✅

## 📝 Important Notes

### Mastery ≠ Unlocking

**Genre mastery does NOT automatically unlock new genres.**

The unlock mechanism will be implemented separately using:
- Achievements
- In-game currency
- Collaborations
- Chart success
- Level requirements
- Or other creative methods

This keeps progression flexible and allows for various unlock strategies.

---

## 🧪 Testing

### Ready to Test:
1. ✅ Create songs in unlocked genres
2. ✅ Verify mastery increases after each song
3. ✅ Check Firebase saves mastery data
4. ✅ Test logout/login preserves mastery
5. ✅ Confirm mastery caps at 100%

### Test Commands:
```dart
// Check mastery after writing song
print('Hip Hop Mastery: ${artistStats.genreMastery["Hip Hop"]}%');

// Get mastery level
print('Level: ${artistStats.getGenreMasteryLevel("Hip Hop")}');
```
