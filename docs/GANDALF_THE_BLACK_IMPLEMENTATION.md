## ✅ Implementation Complete

**Gandalf The Black** is a notorious music critic NPC who posts controversial takes in "The Scoop" news feed, creating drama and stirring up competition between artists.

---

## Features Implemented

### 1. Cloud Functions (Twice Daily Posts)

**Scheduled Function**: `gandalfTheBlackPosts`
- Runs every 12 hours (twice a day)
- Automatically generates controversial posts
- 40% Chart drama, 30% Artist beef, 30% Opinion pieces

**Manual Trigger**: `triggerGandalfPost` (Admin only)
- Callable from Admin Dashboard
- Force generate a Gandalf post for testing

### 2. Post Types

#### A. Chart Drama Posts
Analyzes current vs previous week's charts to find:
- **#1 Spot Changes**: "NEW KING DETHRONED THE OLD GUARD"
- **Big Fallers**: "MASSIVE FLOP ALERT" (songs that dropped 10+ positions)
- **Suspicious Jumpers**: "BOT FARMS?" (songs that rose 10+ positions rapidly)

Example:
```
👑 NEW KING DETHRONED THE OLD GUARD
🔥 [Artist A] just got KNOCKED OFF the #1 spot by [Artist B]'s "[Song]"! 
Is this the end of [Artist A]'s reign? The streets are saying they've lost their edge...
```

#### B. Artist Beef Posts
Pits two random charting artists against each other:
- **Studio Beef**: "Sources say [Artist A] was talking trash about [Artist B]"
- **Copycat Scandal**: "Did [Artist B] just COPY [Artist A]'s sound?"
- **Social Media War**: "Passive-aggressive behavior about to turn into full-on war"

Example:
```
🥊 STUDIO BEEF: SHOTS FIRED
👊 Sources close to [Artist A] say they were TALKING TRASH about [Artist B] 
in the studio last night. Word is [Artist B] is already working on a diss track...
```

#### C. Controversial Opinion Posts
Hot takes on music industry:
- "MODERN POP IS DEAD" - Generic sound complaints
- "STREAMING KILLED MUSIC QUALITY" - Algorithm criticism
- "ROCK IS THE ONLY REAL MUSIC" - Genre war bait
- "BROKE ARTISTS = BAD ARTISTS" - Talent = money equation
- "COLLABORATIONS ARE DESPERATE" - Feature track criticism

Example:
```
🗑️ MODERN POP IS DEAD
💀 Let's be real - pop music in 2020 is TRASH. Every song sounds the same...
Where's the creativity? The golden age of music is OVER. Fight me. 🎤
```
