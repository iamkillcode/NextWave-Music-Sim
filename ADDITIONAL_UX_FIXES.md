# Additional UX Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed (Round 2)

### Issue 5: ✅ Account Deletion Not Working
**Problem:** Account deletion was failing, likely due to Firebase's `requires-recent-login` error.

**Root Cause:** Firebase requires users to have recently authenticated before performing sensitive operations like account deletion. If the user logged in hours ago, the deletion would fail.

**Solution:** Implemented re-authentication flow before account deletion:

1. **Added Password Confirmation Dialog**
   - User clicks "DELETE ACCOUNT"
   - First confirmation dialog warns about permanent deletion
   - Second dialog asks for password confirmation
   - Password is used to re-authenticate before deletion

2. **Re-authentication Logic**
   ```dart
   // Re-authenticate user (required by Firebase before account deletion)
   final credential = EmailAuthProvider.credential(
     email: user.email!,
     password: password,
   );
   
   await user.reauthenticateWithCredential(credential);
   
   // Now safe to delete
   await _firestore.collection('players').doc(userId).delete();
   await user.delete();
   ```

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - `wrong-password` → "Incorrect password. Account deletion cancelled."
   - `requires-recent-login` → "Session expired. Please log out and log back in."
   - `user-mismatch` → "Credential mismatch. Please try again."
   - `invalid-credential` → "Invalid password. Please try again."

**File Changed:** `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`

**New Function Added:** `_showPasswordDialog()` - Creates password input dialog for re-authentication

---

### Issue 6: ✅ Date Format Too Long
**Problem:** Dates displayed as "January 1, 2020" which is verbose and takes up space.

**User Request:** Shorten to "Jan 1, 2020" or "Dec 30, 2020" format.

**Solution:** Changed date format pattern in `formatGameDate()`:

```dart
// BEFORE
String formatGameDate(DateTime gameDate) {
  return DateFormat('MMMM d, yyyy').format(gameDate);
}
// Output: "January 1, 2020"

// AFTER
String formatGameDate(DateTime gameDate) {
  return DateFormat('MMM d, yyyy').format(gameDate);
}
// Output: "Jan 1, 2020"
```

**Changes:**
- `MMMM` (full month name) → `MMM` (abbreviated month name)
- Same format preserved: `d, yyyy` (day and year with comma)

**Benefits:**
- Shorter, cleaner display
- More screen space for other content
- Still clearly readable
- International format widely recognized

**File Changed:** `lib/services/game_time_service.dart`

### Issue 7: ✅ Artist Image Upload
**Status:** Already Implemented!

**User Request:** "There needs to be the option to upload artist image for the streaming platforms"

**Finding:** This feature already exists and is fully functional in the Settings screen.

**How It Works:**
1. User navigates to Settings
2. Profile picture shown with artist initial
3. Small camera icon on bottom-right of avatar
4. Click camera icon to upload image
5. Image picker opens (max 512x512, 85% quality)
6. Image converted to base64 and stored in Firestore
7. Avatar displays uploaded image across the app

**Implementation Details:**
- **Field:** `avatarUrl` in players collection
- **Storage:** Base64 encoded data URL (no Firebase Storage needed)
- **Compression:** Max 512x512 pixels, 85% quality
- **Fallback:** Shows artist name initial if no image
- **Persistence:** Saved to Firestore, persists across sessions

**Code Location:** `lib/screens/settings_screen.dart`
- `_uploadAvatar()` function (line ~210)
- Avatar display in `_buildAccountCard()` (line ~534)

**UI:**
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   ┌───────┐             │
│   │   J   │  📷         │  <- Camera icon for upload
│   └───────┘             │
│   Artist Name           │
│   artist@email.com      │
└─────────────────────────┘
```

**No Changes Needed** - Feature is complete and working!

## Technical Details

### Account Deletion Flow

**Before:**
```
User clicks DELETE → Confirmation → Delete Firestore data → Delete Auth user
❌ Fails with "requires-recent-login" if session is old
```

**After:**
```
User clicks DELETE 
  → First confirmation (permanent warning)
  → Password input dialog
  → Re-authenticate with password
  → Delete Firestore data
  → Delete Auth user
  → Navigate to auth screen
✅ Works reliably with proper security
```

| September 30, 2022 | Sep 30, 2022 | ~6 chars |
| December 25, 2023 | Dec 25, 2023 | ~5 chars |

**Average:** ~5-6 characters shorter per date display

### Artist Image Upload Specs

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Max Width | 512px |
| Max Height | 512px |
| Image Quality | 85% |
| Format | JPEG (base64) |

}

// Updated _deleteAccount() function (lines ~260-371)
Future<void> _deleteAccount() async {
  // Shows confirmation
  // Gets password via _showPasswordDialog()
  // Re-authenticates with EmailAuthProvider.credential()
  // Deletes Firestore data
  // Deletes Auth account
  // Handles 4 specific error cases
}
```

**2. Enhanced Error Handling**
- Added `FirebaseAuthException` specific handling
- 4 new error cases for account deletion:
  - `wrong-password`
