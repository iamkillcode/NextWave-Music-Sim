## 💡 Technical Insights

### Why This Matters

**Traditional Game Design:**
- Client calculates everything

- "Authoritative client" model

**Why That Fails for Multiplayer:**
- Players can cheat
- Unfair timing advantages
- No real-time competition

**Modern MMO Design:**
- Server calculates everything
- Client displays results
- "Authoritative server" model

**Why This Works:**
- Fair competition
- Cheat-proof
- Real-time updates
- Scalable

**NextWave v1.3.0 now follows modern MMO architecture!** 🎮
